# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Removed obsolete `/converted/` directory handling from `collect_papers.py`; the workflow now only tracks required artifact directories, and the change is verified by new unit tests.
- Confirmed via automated tests that functional outputs remain unchanged and no `/converted/` directory is produced.
