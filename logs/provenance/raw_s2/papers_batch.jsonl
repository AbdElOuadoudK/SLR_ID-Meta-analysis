This survey paper presents a taxonomy of contemporary IDS, a comprehensive review of notable recent works, and an overview of the datasets commonly used for evaluation purposes. It also presents evasion techniques used by attackers to avoid detection and discusses future research challenges to counter such techniques so as to make computer systems more secure."}

As a result, many novel attacks are being generated and have posed challenges for network security to accurately detect intrusions. Furthermore, the presence of the intruders with the aim to launch various attacks within the network cannot be ignored. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one such tool that prevents the network from possible intrusions by inspecting the network traffic, to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Despite enormous efforts by the researchers, IDS still faces challenges in improving detection accuracy while reducing false alarm rates and in detecting novel intrusions. Recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)‐based IDS systems are being deployed as potential solutions to detect intrusions across the network in an efficient manner. This article first clarifies the concept of IDS and then provides the taxonomy based on the notable ML and DL techniques adopted in designing network‐based IDS (NIDS) systems. A comprehensive review of the recent NIDS‐based articles is provided by discussing the strengths and limitations of the proposed solutions. Then, recent trends and advancements of ML and DL‐based NIDS are provided in terms of the proposed methodology, evaluation metrics, and dataset selection. Using the shortcomings of the proposed methods, we highlighted various research challenges and provided the future scope for the research in improving ML and DL‐based NIDS."}

An intrusion detection system (IDS) which is an important cyber security technique, monitors the state of software and hardware running in the network. Despite decades of development, existing IDSs still face challenges in improving the detection accuracy, reducing the false alarm rate and detecting unknown attacks. To solve the above problems, many researchers have focused on developing IDSs that capitalize on machine learning methods. Machine learning methods can automatically discover the essential differences between normal data and abnormal data with high accuracy. In addition, machine learning methods have strong generalizability, so they are also able to detect unknown attacks. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, whose performance is remarkable and has become a research hotspot. This survey proposes a taxonomy of IDS that takes data objects as the main dimension to classify and summarize machine learning-based and deep learning-based IDS literature. We believe that this type of taxonomy framework is fit for cyber security researchers. The survey first clarifies the concept and taxonomy of IDSs. Then, the machine learning algorithms frequently used in IDSs, metrics, and benchmark datasets are introduced.

The 2016 Dyn cyberattack exposed the critical fault-lines among smart networks. Security of IoT has become a critical concern. The danger exposed by infested Internet-connected Things not only affects the security of IoT but also threatens the complete Internet eco-system which can possibly exploit the vulnerable Things (smart devices) deployed as botnets. Mirai malware compromised the video surveillance devices and paralyzed Internet via distributed denial of service attacks. In the recent past, security attack vectors have evolved bothways, in terms of complexity and diversity. Hence, to identify and prevent or detect novel attacks, it is important to analyze techniques in IoT context. This survey classifies the IoT security threats and challenges for IoT networks by evaluating existing defense techniques. Our main focus is on network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs); hence, this paper reviews existing NIDS implementation tools and datasets as well as free and open-source network sniffing software. Then, it surveys, analyzes, and compares state-of-the-art NIDS proposals in the IoT context in terms of architecture, detection methodologies, validation strategies, treated threats, and algorithm deployments. The review deals with both traditional and machine learning (ML) NIDS techniques and discusses future directions. In this survey, our focus is on IoT NIDS deployed via ML since learning algorithms have a good success rate in security and privacy. The survey provides a comprehensive review of NIDSs deploying different aspects of learning techniques for IoT, unlike other top surveys targeting the traditional systems. We believe that, this paper will be useful for academia and industry research, first, to identify IoT threats and challenges, second, to implement their own NIDS and finally to propose new smart techniques in IoT context considering IoT limitations. Moreover, the survey will enable security individuals differentiate IoT NIDS from traditional ones."}

To this end, several surveys were put forward addressing various IoT-centric topics, including intrusion detection systems, threat modeling, and emerging technologies. In contrast, in this paper, we exclusively focus on the ever-evolving IoT vulnerabilities. In this context, we initially provide a comprehensive classification of state-of-the-art surveys, which address various dimensions of the IoT paradigm. This aims at facilitating IoT research endeavors by amalgamating, comparing, and contrasting dispersed research contributions. Subsequently, we provide a unique taxonomy, which sheds the light on IoT vulnerabilities, their attack vectors, impacts on numerous security objectives, attacks which exploit such vulnerabilities, corresponding remediation methodologies and currently offered operational cyber security capabilities to infer and monitor such weaknesses. This aims at providing the reader with a multidimensional research perspective related to IoT vulnerabilities, including their technical details and consequences, which is postulated to be leveraged for remediation objectives. Additionally, motivated by the lack of empirical (and malicious) data related to the IoT paradigm, this paper also presents a first look on Internet-scale IoT exploitations by drawing upon more than 1.2 GB of macroscopic, passive measurements’ data. This aims at practically highlighting the severity of the IoT problem, while providing operational situational awareness capabilities, which undoubtedly would aid in the mitigation task, at large. Insightful findings, inferences and outcomes in addition to open challenges and research problems are also disclosed in this paper, which we hope would pave the way for future research endeavors addressing theoretical and empirical aspects related to the imperative topic of IoT security."}

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like public key infrastructure (PKI)-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends."}

Regardless of successful applications of machine learning algorithms in many scenarios, e.g., facial recognition, malware detection, automatic driving, and intrusion detection, these algorithms and corresponding training data are vulnerable to a variety of security threats, inducing a significant performance decrease. Hence, it is vital to call for further attention regarding security threats and corresponding defensive techniques of machine learning, which motivates a comprehensive survey in this paper. Until now, researchers from academia and industry have found out many security threats against a variety of learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), principle component analysis, clustering, and prevailing deep neural networks. Thus, we revisit existing security threats and give a systematic survey on them from two aspects, the training phase and the testing/inferring phase. After that, we categorize current defensive techniques of machine learning into four groups: security assessment mechanisms, countermeasures in the training phase, those in the testing or inferring phase, data security, and privacy. Finally, we provide five notable trends in the research on security threats and defensive techniques of machine learning, which are worth doing in-depth studies in future."}

This paper presents a comprehensive study of RPL, its known attacks, and the mitigation methods proposed to counter these attacks. We conducted a detailed review of the RPL standard, including a recently proposed modification. Also, we investigated all recently published attacks on RPL and their mitigation methods through the literature. Based on this investigation, and to the best of our knowledge, we introduced a first-of-its-kind classification scheme for the mitigation methods that is based on the techniques used for the mitigation. Furthermore, we thoroughly discussed RPL-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and their classifications, highlighting the most recently proposed IDSs."}

With the proliferation of deep learning methods, researchers have recently investigated these methods for traffic classification and reported high accuracy. In this article, we introduce a general framework for deep-learning-based traffic classification. We present commonly used deep learning methods and their application in traffic classification tasks.

Furthermore, since ICSs are often employed in critical infrastructures (e.g., nuclear plants) and manufacturing companies (e.g., chemical industries), attacks can lead to devastating physical damages. In dealing with this security requirement, the research community focuses on developing new security mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), facilitated by leveraging modern machine learning techniques. However, these algorithms require a testing platform and a considerable amount of data to be trained and tested accurately. To satisfy this prerequisite, Academia, Industry, and Government are increasingly proposing testbed (i.e., scaled-down versions of ICSs or simulations) to test the performances of the IDSs. Furthermore, to enable researchers to cross-validate security systems (e.g., security-by-design concepts or anomaly detectors), several datasets have been collected from testbeds and shared with the community. In this paper, we provide a deep and comprehensive overview of ICSs, presenting the architecture design, the employed devices, and the security protocols implemented. We then collect, compare, and describe testbeds and datasets in the literature, highlighting key challenges and design guidelines to keep in mind in the design phases. Furthermore, we enrich our work by reporting the best performing IDS algorithms tested on every dataset to create a baseline in state of the art for this field. Finally, driven by knowledge accumulated during this survey’s development, we report advice and good practices on the development, the choice, and the utilization of testbeds, datasets, and IDSs."}

By incorporating deep learning into traditional RL, DRL is highly capable of solving complex, dynamic, and especially high-dimensional cyber defense problems. This article presents a survey of DRL approaches developed for cyber security. We touch on different vital aspects, including DRL-based security methods for cyber–physical systems, autonomous intrusion detection techniques, and multiagent DRL-based game theory simulations for defense strategies against cyberattacks.

Improvements to Intrusion Detection could be achieved by embracing a more comprehensive approach in monitoring security events from many different heterogeneous sources. Correlating security events from heterogeneous sources can grant a more holistic view and greater situational awareness of cyber threats. One problem with this approach is that currently, even a single event source (e.g., network traffic) can experience Big Data challenges when considered alone. Attempts to use more heterogeneous data sources pose an even greater Big Data challenge. Big Data technologies for Intrusion Detection can help solve these Big Heterogeneous Data challenges. In this paper, we review the scope of works considering the problem of heterogeneous data and in particular Big Heterogeneous Data. We discuss the specific issues of Data Fusion, Heterogeneous Intrusion Detection Architectures, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, as well as presenting areas where more research opportunities exist. Overall, both cyber threat analysis and cyber intelligence could be enhanced by correlating security events across many diverse heterogeneous sources."}

In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been increasingly used in NIDS to detect malicious traffic due to their high detection accuracy. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that modify an input example with imperceivable perturbation, which causes a misclassification by the DNN. In security-sensitive domains, such as NIDS, adversarial attacks pose a severe threat to network security. However, existing studies in adversarial learning against NIDS directly implement adversarial attacks designed for Computer Vision (CV) tasks, ignoring the fundamental differences in the detection pipeline and feature spaces between CV and NIDS. It remains a major research challenge to launch and detect adversarial attacks against NIDS. This article surveys the recent literature on NIDS, adversarial attacks, and network defences since 2015 to examine the differences in adversarial learning against deep neural networks in CV and NIDS. It provides the reader with a thorough understanding of DL-based NIDS, adversarial attacks and defences, and research trends in this field. We first present a taxonomy of DL-based NIDS and discuss the impact of taxonomy on adversarial learning. Next, we review existing white-box and black-box adversarial attacks on DNNs and their applicability in the NIDS domain. Finally, we review existing defence mechanisms against adversarial examples and their characteristics."}

In order to enhance the detection capability of a single IDS, collaborative intrusion detection networks (or collaborative IDSs) have been developed, which allow IDS nodes to exchange data with each other. However, data and trust management still remain two challenges for current detection architectures, which may degrade the effectiveness of such detection systems. In recent years, blockchain technology has shown its adaptability in many fields, such as supply chain management, international payment, interbanking, and so on. As blockchain can protect the integrity of data storage and ensure process transparency, it has a potential to be applied to intrusion detection domain. Motivated by this, this paper provides a review regarding the intersection of IDSs and blockchains. In particular, we introduce the background of intrusion detection and blockchain, discuss the applicability of blockchain to intrusion detection, and identify open challenges in this direction."}

Intrusion detection, an effective method for defending against cyberattacks on IVNs while providing functional safety and real-time communication guarantees, aims to address this issue. Therefore, the necessity of its research has risen. In this paper, an IVN environment is introduced, and the constraints and characteristics of an intrusion detection system (IDS) design for IVNs are presented. A survey of the proposed IDS designs for the IVNs is conducted, and the corresponding drawbacks are highlighted. Various optimization objectives are considered and comprehensively compared. Lastly, the trend, open issues, and emerging research directions are described."}

Various automotive serial protocols are used inside vehicles such as Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect Network (LIN), and FlexRay. CAN Bus is the most used in-vehicle network protocol to support exchange of vehicle parameters between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This protocol lacks security mechanisms by design and is therefore vulnerable to various attacks. Furthermore, connectivity of vehicles has made the CAN Bus vulnerable not only from within the vehicle but also from outside. With the rise of connected cars, more entry points and interfaces have been introduced on board vehicles, thereby also leading to a wider potential attack surface. Existing security mechanisms focus on the use of encryption, authentication, and vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which operate under various constraints such as low bandwidth, small frame size (e.g., in the CAN protocol), limited availability of computational resources, and real-time sensitivity. We survey and classify current cryptographic and IDS approaches and compare these approaches based on criteria such as real-time constraints, types of hardware used, changes in CAN Bus behaviour, types of attack mitigation, and software/ hardware used to validate these approaches. We conclude with mitigation strategies limitations and research challenges for the future."}

The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has recently evolved into a technology for building smart environments. Security and privacy are considered key issues in any real-world smart environment based on the IoT model. The security vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems create security threats that affect smart environment applications. Thus, there is a crucial need for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) designed for IoT environments to mitigate IoT-related security attacks that exploit some of these security vulnerabilities. Due to the limited computing and storage capabilities of IoT devices and the specific protocols used, conventional IDSs may not be an option for IoT environments. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the latest IDSs designed for the IoT model, with a focus on the corresponding methods, features, and mechanisms. This article also provides deep insight into the IoT architecture, emerging security vulnerabilities, and their relation to the layers of the IoT architecture. This work demonstrates that despite previous studies regarding the design and implementation of IDSs for the IoT paradigm, developing efficient, reliable and robust IDSs for IoT-based smart environments is still a crucial task. Key considerations for the development of such IDSs are introduced as a future outlook at the end of this survey."}

Specifically, we first provide a review of the federated learning-based security and privacy systems for several types of IoT applications, including, Industrial IoT, Edge Computing, Internet of Drones, Internet of Healthcare Things, Internet of Vehicles, etc. Second, the use of federated learning with blockchain and malware/intrusion detection systems for IoT applications is discussed. Then, we review the vulnerabilities in federated learning-based security and privacy systems. Finally, we provide an experimental analysis of federated deep learning with three deep learning approaches, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). For each deep learning model, we study the performance of centralized and federated learning under three new real IoT traffic datasets, namely, the Bot-IoT dataset, the MQTTset dataset, and the TON_IoT dataset. The goal of this article is to provide important information on federated deep learning approaches with emerging technologies for cyber security. In addition, it demonstrates that federated deep learning approaches outperform the classic/centralized versions of machine learning (non-federated learning) in assuring the privacy of IoT device data and provide the higher accuracy in detecting attacks."}

Despite the AI benefits, its application suffers from the opacity of complex internal mechanisms and doesn’t satisfy by design the principles of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The lack of transparency further exacerbates the problem in the field of CyberSecurity because entrusting crucial decisions to a system that cannot explain itself presents obvious dangers. There are several methods in the literature capable of providing explainability of AI results. Anyway, the application of XAI in CyberSecurity can be a double-edged sword. It substantially improves the CyberSecurity practices but simultaneously leaves the system vulnerable to adversary attacks. Therefore, there is a need to analyze the state-of-the-art of XAI methods in CyberSecurity to provide a clear vision for future research. This study presents an in-depth examination of the application of XAI in CyberSecurity. It considers more than 300 papers to comprehensively analyze the main CyberSecurity application fields, like Intrusion Detection Systems, Malware detection, Phishing and Spam detection, BotNets detection, Fraud detection, Zero-Day vulnerabilities, Digital Forensics and Crypto-Jacking. Specifically, this study focuses on the explainability methods adopted or proposed in these fields, pointing out promising works and new challenges."}

This survey paper presents a comprehensive review of contemporary IoT IDS and an overview of techniques, deployment Strategy, validation strategy and datasets that are commonly applied for building IDS. We also review how existing IoT IDS detect intrusive attacks and secure communications on the IoT. It also presents the classification of IoT attacks and discusses future research challenges to counter such IoT attacks to make IoT more secure.

The cyberspace has become more vulnerable to automated and prolonged cyberattacks. Cyber security techniques provide enhancements in security measures to detect and react against cyberattacks. The previously used security systems are no longer sufficient because cybercriminals are smart enough to evade conventional security systems. Conventional security systems lack efficiency in detecting previously unseen and polymorphic security attacks. Machine learning (ML) techniques are playing a vital role in numerous applications of cyber security. However, despite the ongoing success, there are significant challenges in ensuring the trustworthiness of ML systems. There are incentivized malicious adversaries present in the cyberspace that are willing to game and exploit such ML vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges that ML techniques face in protecting cyberspace against attacks, by presenting a literature on ML techniques for cyber security including intrusion detection, spam detection, and malware detection on computer networks and mobile networks in the last decade. It also provides brief descriptions of each ML method, frequently used security datasets, essential ML tools, and evaluation metrics to evaluate a classification model. It finally discusses the challenges of using ML techniques in cyber security. This paper provides the latest extensive bibliography and the current trends of ML in cyber security."}

Due to the rapid development of Internet-connected systems and Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Artificial Intelligence including Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) has been widely utilized in the fields of cyber security including intrusion detection, malware detection, and spam filtering. However, although Artificial Intelligence-based approaches for the detection and defense of cyber attacks and threats are more advanced and efficient compared to the conventional signature-based and rule-based cyber security strategies, most ML-based techniques and DL-based techniques are deployed in the “black-box” manner, meaning that security experts and customers are unable to explain how such procedures reach particular conclusions. The deficiencies of transparencies and interpretability of existing Artificial Intelligence techniques would decrease human users’ confidence in the models utilized for the defense against cyber attacks, especially in current situations where cyber attacks become increasingly diverse and complicated. Therefore, it is essential to apply XAI in the establishment of cyber security models to create more explainable models while maintaining high accuracy and allowing human users to comprehend, trust, and manage the next generation of cyber defense mechanisms. Although there are papers reviewing Artificial Intelligence applications in cyber security areas and the vast literature on applying XAI in many fields including healthcare, financial services, and criminal justice, the surprising fact is that there are currently no survey research articles that concentrate on XAI applications in cyber security. Therefore, the motivation behind the survey is to bridge the research gap by presenting a detailed and up-to-date survey of XAI approaches applicable to issues in the cyber security field. Our work is the first to propose a clear roadmap for navigating the XAI literature in the context of applications in cyber security."}

These applications arguably can brace various domains for smart home and office environments, including safety protection, well-being monitoring/management, smart healthcare and smart-appliance interaction. The movements of the human body impact the wireless signal propagation (e.g., reflection, diffraction and scattering), which provide great opportunities to capture human motions by analyzing the received wireless signals. Researchers take the advantage of the existing wireless links among mobile/smart devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, smart thermostats, smart refrigerators and virtual assistance systems) by either extracting the ready-to-use signal measurements or adopting frequency modulated signals to detect the frequency shift. Due to the low-cost and non-intrusive sensing nature, wireless-based human activity sensing has drawn considerable attention and become a prominent research field over the past decade. In this paper, we survey the existing wireless sensing systems in terms of their basic principles, techniques and system structures. Particularly, we describe how the wireless signals could be utilized to facilitate an array of applications including intrusion detection, room occupancy monitoring, daily activity recognition, gesture recognition, vital signs monitoring, user identification and indoor localization. The future research directions and limitations of using wireless signals for human activity sensing are also discussed."}

In this survey, we review the methods that have been applied to network data with the purpose of developing an intrusion detector, but contrary to previous reviews in the area, we analyze them from the perspective of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process. As such, we discuss the techniques used for the collecion, preprocessing and transformation of the data, as well as the data mining and evaluation methods. We also present the characteristics and motivations behind the use of each of these techniques and propose more adequate and up-to-date taxonomies and definitions for intrusion detectors based on the terminology used in the area of data mining and KDD. Special importance is given to the evaluation procedures followed to assess the detectors, discussing their applicability in current, real networks. Finally, as a result of this literature review, we investigate some open issues which will need to be considered for further research in the area of network security."}

In addition, modern vehicles are becoming increasingly connected to the outside world through V2X technologies. However, these provide new attack surfaces that increase the cybersecurity risk to modern vehicles. To this end, there are two distinct and key challenges that need to be addressed to ensure safety and consumer trust. While modern vehicles must be equipped with the best countermeasures against cybersecurity threats, a reliable mechanism shall be also in place to detect the potential intrusions of the system while in operation, which is termed as intrusion detection. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive review of the state of the art of the intra-vehicle intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for passenger vehicles. We first provide an overview of intra-vehicle networks before reviewing contemporary research in intra-vehicle IDSs. The approach employed is to categorize the reviewed works based on their detection technique and to examine the used feature and feature selection methods, evaluation dataset, attack type, performance metrics, and benchmark models. This paper also presents outstanding research challenges and gaps in intra-vehicle IDS research."}

Various machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed for implementing anomaly-based IDS (AIDS). Our review of the AIDS literature identifies some issues in related work, including the randomness of the selected algorithms, parameters, and testing criteria, the application of old datasets, or shallow analyses and validation of the results. This paper comprehensively reviews previous studies on AIDS by using a set of criteria with different datasets and types of attacks to set benchmarking outcomes that can reveal the suitable AIDS algorithms, parameters, and testing criteria. Specifically, this paper applies 10 popular supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms for identifying effective and efficient ML–AIDS of networks and computers. These supervised ML algorithms include the artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, whereas the unsupervised ML algorithms include the expectation-maximization (EM), k-means, and self-organizing maps (SOM) algorithms. Several models of these algorithms are introduced, and the turning and training parameters of each algorithm are examined to achieve an optimal classifier evaluation. Unlike previous studies, this study evaluates the performance of AIDS by measuring the true positive and negative rates, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Score of 31 ML-AIDS models. The training and testing time for ML-AIDS models are also considered in measuring their performance efficiency given that time complexity is an important factor in AIDSs. The ML-AIDS models are tested by using a recent and highly unbalanced multiclass CICIDS2017 dataset that involves real-world network attacks. In general, the k-NN-AIDS, DT-AIDS, and NB-AIDS models obtain the best results and show a greater capability in detecting web attacks compared with other models that demonstrate irregular and inferior results."}

Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation. However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development of agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three typical development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility agriculture, and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications, 6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control, privacy-preserving, blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management, physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems) are summarized and discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments based on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate that agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more technologies (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future research directions of smart agriculture."}

The rapid development of IoT devices and networks in various forms generate enormous amounts of data which in turn demand careful authentication and security. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising methods for addressing cybersecurity threats and providing security. In this study, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) that categorize, map and survey the existing literature on AI methods used to detect cybersecurity attacks in the IoT environment. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation on most AI trending techniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions. A systematic search was performed on various electronic databases (SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out of the identified records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed and carefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in detecting attacks. However, several studies have proposed smart intrusion detection systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks using AI to overcome the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to high accuracy detection another reason may be efficient memory. In addition, other methods also provide better performance such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). This analysis also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats based on attack categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations."}

With the increase in the number of connected devices, several challenges are also coming up with IoT technology: heterogeneity, scalability, quality of service, security requirements, and many more. Security management takes a back seat in IoT because of cost, size, and power. It poses a significant risk as lack of security makes users skeptical towards using IoT devices. This, in turn, makes IoT vulnerable to security attacks, ultimately causing enormous financial and reputational losses. It makes up for an urgent need to assess present security risks and discuss the upcoming challenges to be ready to face the same. The undertaken study is a multi-fold survey of different security issues present in IoT layers: perception layer, network layer, support layer, application layer, with further focus on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are significant threats for the cyber world because of their potential to bring down the victims. Different types of DDoS attacks, DDoS attacks in IoT devices, impacts of DDoS attacks, and solutions for mitigation are discussed in detail. The presented review work compares Intrusion Detection and Prevention models for mitigating DDoS attacks and focuses on Intrusion Detection models. Furthermore, the classification of Intrusion Detection Systems, different anomaly detection techniques, different Intrusion Detection System models based on datasets, various machine learning and deep learning techniques for data pre-processing and malware detection has been discussed. In the end, a broader perspective has been envisioned while discussing research challenges, its proposed solutions, and future visions."}

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated this process. As a result of the widespread usage of the digital environment, traditional crimes have also shifted to the digital space. Emerging technologies such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, wireless communication, and cryptocurrencies are raising security concerns in cyberspace. Recently, cyber criminals have started to use cyber attacks as a service to automate attacks and leverage their impact. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that exist in hardware, software, and communication layers. Various types of cyber attacks include distributed denial of service (DDoS), phishing, man-in-the-middle, password, remote, privilege escalation, and malware. Due to new-generation attacks and evasion techniques, traditional protection systems such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, antivirus software, access control lists, etc., are no longer effective in detecting these sophisticated attacks. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find innovative and more feasible solutions to prevent cyber attacks. The paper first extensively explains the main reasons for cyber attacks. Then, it reviews the most recent attacks, attack patterns, and detection techniques. Thirdly, the article discusses contemporary technical and nontechnical solutions for recognizing attacks in advance. Using trending technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, cloud platforms, big data, and blockchain can be a promising solution for current and future cyber attacks. These technological solutions may assist in detecting malware, intrusion detection, spam identification, DNS attack classification, fraud detection, recognizing hidden channels, and distinguishing advanced persistent threats. However, some promising solutions, especially machine learning and deep learning, are not resistant to evasion techniques, which must be considered when proposing solutions against intelligent cyber attacks."}

These cybersecurity risk detection methods mainly comprise of fraud detection, intrusion detection, spam detection, and malware detection. In this review paper, we build upon the existing literature of applications of ML models in cybersecurity and provide a comprehensive review of ML techniques in cybersecurity. To the best of our knowledge, we have made the first attempt to give a comparison of the time complexity of commonly used ML models in cybersecurity. We have comprehensively compared each classifier’s performance based on frequently used datasets and sub-domains of cyber threats. This work also provides a brief introduction of machine learning models besides commonly used security datasets.

In this paper, we briefly survey the state-of-the-art IDS mechanisms that deal with vulnerabilities and attacks under networked UAV environments. In particular, we classify the existing IDS mechanisms according to information gathering sources, deployment strategies, detection methods, detection states, IDS acknowledgment, and intrusion types.

In this paper, a survey on intelligent techniques for feature selection and classification for intrusion detection in networks based on intelligent software agents, neural networks, genetic algorithms, neuro-genetic algorithms, fuzzy techniques, rough sets, and particle swarm intelligence has been proposed. These techniques have been useful for effectively identifying and preventing network intrusions in order to provide security to the Internet and to enhance the quality of service.

The number of threats that individuals and businesses face is rising exponentially due to the increasing complexity of networks and services of modern networks. To alleviate the impact of these threats, researchers have proposed numerous solutions for anomaly detection; however, current tools often fail to adapt to ever-changing architectures, associated threats and zero-day attacks. This manuscript aims to pinpoint research gaps and shortcomings of current datasets, their impact on building Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and the growing number of sophisticated threats. To this end, this manuscript provides researchers with two key pieces of information; a survey of prominent datasets, analyzing their use and impact on the development of the past decade’s Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and a taxonomy of network threats and associated tools to carry out these attacks. The manuscript highlights that current IDS research covers only 33.3% of our threat taxonomy. Current datasets demonstrate a clear lack of real-network threats, attack representation and include a large number of deprecated threats, which together limit the detection accuracy of current machine learning IDS approaches. The unique combination of the taxonomy and the analysis of the datasets provided in this manuscript aims to improve the creation of datasets and the collection of real-world data. As a result, this will improve the efficiency of the next generation IDS and reflect network threats more accurately within new datasets."}

This has increased the need for Internet networks to be secured. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), which employ artificial intelligence (AI) methods, are vital to ensuring network security. As a branch of AI, deep learning (DL) algorithms are now effectively applied in IDSs. Among deep learning neural networks, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is a well-known structure designed to process complex data. The CNN overcomes the typical limitations of conventional machine learning approaches and is mainly used in IDSs. Several CNN-based approaches are employed in IDSs to handle privacy issues and security threats. However, there are no comprehensive surveys of IDS schemes that have utilized CNN to the best of our knowledge. Hence, in this study, our primary focus is on CNN-based IDSs so as to increase our understanding of various uses of the CNN in detecting network intrusions, anomalies, and other types of attacks. This paper innovatively organizes the studied CNN-IDS approaches into multiple categories and describes their primary capabilities and contributions. The main features of these approaches, such as the dataset, architecture, input shape, evaluated metrics, performance, feature extraction, and classifier method, are compared. Because different datasets are used in CNN-IDS research, their experimental results are not comparable. Hence, this study also conducted an empirical experiment to compare different approaches based on standard datasets, and the comparative results are presented in detail."}

On the other hand, AI models will face various cyber threats, which will disturb their sample, learning, and decisions. Thus, AI models need specific cyber security defense and protection technologies to combat adversarial machine learning, preserve privacy in machine learning, secure federated learning, etc. Based on the above two aspects, we review the intersection of AI and cyber security. First, we summarize existing research efforts in terms of combating cyber attacks using AI, including adopting traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning solutions. Then, we analyze the counterattacks from which AI itself may suffer, dissect their characteristics, and classify the corresponding defense methods. Finally, from the aspects of constructing encrypted neural network and realizing a secure federated deep learning, we expatiate the existing research on how to build a secure AI system."}

With the growing pace at which new attacks are developed, conventional signature based attack detection methods are often not enough, and machine learning poses as a potential solution. Adversarial machine learning is a research area that examines both the generation and detection of adversarial examples, which are inputs specially crafted to deceive classifiers, and has been extensively studied specifically in the area of image recognition, where minor modifications are performed on images that cause a classifier to produce incorrect predictions. However, in other fields, such as intrusion and malware detection, the exploration of such methods is still growing. The aim of this survey is to explore works that apply adversarial machine learning concepts to intrusion and malware detection scenarios. We concluded that a wide variety of attacks were tested and proven effective in malware and intrusion detection, although their practicality was not tested in intrusion scenarios. Adversarial defenses were substantially less explored, although their effectiveness was also proven at resisting adversarial attacks. We also concluded that, contrarily to malware scenarios, the variety of datasets in intrusion scenarios is still very small, with the most used dataset being greatly outdated."}

To detect and mitigate these network attacks, researchers, academicians, and practitioners developed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) with automatic response systems. The response system is considered an important component of IDS, since without a timely response IDSs may not function properly in countering various attacks, especially on a real-time basis. To respond appropriately, IDSs should select the optimal response option according to the type of network attack. This research study provides a complete survey of IDSs and Intrusion Response Systems (IRSs) on the basis of our in-depth understanding of the response option for different types of network attacks. Knowledge of the path from IDS to IRS can assist network administrators and network staffs in understanding how to tackle different attacks with state-of-the-art technologies."}

It has drawn considerable interest in the field of data mining and machine learning. Outlier detection is important in many applications, including fraud detection in credit card transactions and network intrusion detection. There are two general types of outlier detection: global and local. Global outliers fall outside the normal range for an entire dataset, whereas local outliers may fall within the normal range for the entire dataset, but outside the normal range for the surrounding data points. This paper addresses local outlier detection. The best-known technique for local outlier detection is the Local Outlier Factor (LOF), a density-based technique. There are many LOF algorithms for a static data environment; however, these algorithms cannot be applied directly to data streams, which are an important type of big data. In general, local outlier detection algorithms for data streams are still deficient and better algorithms need to be developed that can effectively analyze the high velocity of data streams to detect local outliers. This paper presents a literature review of local outlier detection algorithms in static and stream environments, with an emphasis on LOF algorithms. It collects and categorizes existing local outlier detection algorithms and analyzes their characteristics. Furthermore, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of those algorithms and proposes several promising directions for developing improved local outlier detection methods for data streams."}

However, the privacy and security issues of DL have been revealed that the DL model can be stolen or reverse engineered, sensitive training data can be inferred, even a recognizable face image of the victim can be recovered. Besides, the recent works have found that the DL model is vulnerable to adversarial examples perturbed by imperceptible noised, which can lead the DL model to predict wrongly with high confidence. In this paper, we first briefly introduces the four types of attacks and privacy-preserving techniques in DL. We then review and summarize the attack and defense methods associated with DL privacy and security in recent years. To demonstrate that security threats really exist in the real world, we also reviewed the adversarial attacks under the physical condition.

The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) it presents the results of a systematic review of industry 4.0 regarding attacks, vulnerabilities and defense strategies, (2) it details and classifies the attacks, vulnerabilities and defenses mechanisms, and (3) it presents a discussion of recent challenges and trends regarding cybersecurity-related areas for Industry 4.0. From the systematic review, regarding the attacks, the results show that most attacks are carried out on the network layer, where dos-related and mitm attacks are the most prevalent ones. Regarding vulnerabilities, security flaws in services and source code, and incorrect validations in authentication procedures are highlighted. These are vulnerabilities that can be exploited by dos attacks and buffer overflows in industrial devices and networks. Regarding defense strategies, Blockchain is presented as one of the most relevant technologies under study in terms of defense mechanisms, thanks to its ability to be used in a variety of solutions, from Intrusion Detection Systems to the prevention of Distributed dos attacks, and most defense strategies are presented as an after-attack solution or prevention, in the sense that the defense mechanisms are only placed or thought, only after the harm has been done, and not as a mitigation strategy to prevent the cyberattack. Concerning challenges and trends, the review shows that digital sovereignty, cyber sovereignty, and data sovereignty are recent topics being explored by researchers within the Industry 4.0 scope, and GAIA-X and International Data Spaces are recent initiatives regarding data sovereignty. A discussion of trends is provided, and future challenges are pointed out."}

Because of this advancement, new computing and communication environment such as Internet of Things (IoT) came into picture. Lot of research work is in progress in IoT domain which helps for the overall development of the society and makes the lives easy and comfortable. But in the resource constrained environment of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and IoT, it is almost inconceivable to establish a fully secure system.

In future, the number of Internet connected people will be less than the smart objects so we need to prepare a robust system for keeping the above mentioned environments safe and standardized it for the smooth conduction of communication among IoT objects.

Intruders discover new attack types day by day, therefore to prevent these attacks firstly they need to be identified correctly by the used intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and then proper responses should be given. IDSs, which play a very crucial role for the security of the network, consist of three main components: data collection, feature selection/conversion and decision engine. The last component directly affects the efficiency of the system and use of machine learning techniques is one of most promising research areas. Recently, deep learning has been emerged as a new approach which enables the use of Big Data with a low training time and high accuracy rate with its distinctive learning mechanism. Consequently, it has been started to use in IDS systems. In this paper, it is aimed to survey deep learning based intrusion detection system approach by making a comparative work of the literature and by giving the background knowledge either in deep learning algorithms or in intrusion detection systems."}

Most of the networks were designed with little concern about security which has recently motivated researchers to demonstrate various kinds of attacks against the system. In this paper, we discussed the vulnerabilities of the Controller Area Network (CAN) within in-vehicle communication protocol along with some potential attacks that could be exploited against it. Besides, we present some of the security solutions proposed in the current state of research in order to overcome the attacks. However, the main goal of this paper is to highlight a holistic approach known as intrusion detection system (IDS) which has been a significant tool in securing networks and information systems over the past decades. To the best of our knowledge, there is no recorded literature on a comprehensive overview of IDS implementation specifically in the CAN bus network system. Thus, we proposed an in-depth investigation of IDS found in the literature based on the following aspects: detection approaches, deployment strategies, attacking techniques, and finally technical challenges. In addition, we also categorized the anomaly-based IDS according to these methods, e.g., frequency-based, machine learning-based, statistical-based, and hybrid-based as part of our contributions. Correspondingly, this study will help to accelerate other researchers to pursue IDS research in the CAN bus system."}

However, sharing the same fundamental limitation with other DL application domains, such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), AI-based cybersecurity solutions are incapable of justifying the results (ranging from detection and prediction to reasoning and decision-making) and making them understandable to humans. Consequently, explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a paramount topic addressing the related challenges of making AI models explainable or interpretable to human users. It is particularly relevant in cybersecurity domain, in that XAI may allow security operators, who are overwhelmed with tens of thousands of security alerts per day (most of which are false positives), to better assess the potential threats and reduce alert fatigue. We conduct an extensive literature review on the intersection between XAI and cybersecurity. Particularly, we investigate the existing literature from two perspectives: the applications of XAI to cybersecurity (e.g., intrusion detection, malware classification), and the security of XAI (e.g., attacks on XAI pipelines, potential countermeasures). We characterize the security of XAI with several security properties that have been discussed in the literature. We also formulate open questions that are either unanswered or insufficiently addressed in the literature, and discuss future directions of research."}

However, applications of machine learning in network security face more disproportionate threat of active adversarial attacks compared to other domains. This is because machine learning applications in network security such as malware detection, intrusion detection, and spam filtering are by themselves adversarial in nature. In what could be considered an arm's race between attackers and defenders, adversaries constantly probe machine learning systems with inputs which are explicitly designed to bypass the system and induce a wrong prediction. In this survey, we first provide a taxonomy of machine learning techniques, tasks, and depth. We then introduce a classification of machine learning in network security applications. Next, we examine various adversarial attacks against machine learning in network security and introduce two classification approaches for adversarial attacks in network security. First, we classify adversarial attacks in network security based on a taxonomy of network security applications. Secondly, we categorize adversarial attacks in network security into a problem space vs. feature space dimensional classification model. We then analyze the various defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning-based network security applications. We conclude by introducing an adversarial risk grid map and evaluate several existing adversarial attacks against machine learning in network security using the risk grid map. We also identify where each attack classification resides within the adversarial risk grid map."}

Alongside these challenges, the number of threats is rising exponentially due to the attack surface increasing through numerous interfaces offered for each service. To alleviate the impact of these threats, researchers have proposed numerous solutions; however, current tools often fail to adapt to ever-changing architectures, associated threats and 0-days. This manuscript aims to provide researchers with a taxonomy and survey of current dataset composition and current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) capabilities and assets. These taxonomies and surveys aim to improve both the efficiency of IDS and the creation of datasets to build the next generation IDS as well as to reflect networks threats more accurately in future datasets. To this end, this manuscript also provides a taxonomy and survey or network threats and associated tools. The manuscript highlights that current IDS only cover 25% of our threat taxonomy, while current datasets demonstrate clear lack of real-network threats and attack representation, but rather include a large number of deprecated threats, hence limiting the accuracy of current machine learning IDS. Moreover, the taxonomies are open-sourced to allow public contributions through a Github repository."}

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role as a defense mechanism in networks against adversarial attackers. Machine Learning methods provide various cybersecurity tools. However, these methods require plenty of data to be trained efficiently, which may be hard to collect or to use due to privacy reasons. One of the most notable Machine Learning tools is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and it has great potential for tabular data synthesis. In this work, we start by briefly presenting the most popular GAN architectures, VanillaGAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP. Focusing on tabular data generation, CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and TableGAN models are used for the creation of synthetic IDS data. Specifically, the models are trained and evaluated on an NSL-KDD dataset, considering the limitations and requirements that this procedure needs. Finally, based on certain quantitative and qualitative methods, we argue and evaluate the most prominent GANs for tabular network data synthesis."}

This has also created a new requirement for a comprehensive comparison of the existing schemes in several aspects ; after a thorough study we found that there currently exists no detailed comparative analysis of artificial intelligence-based techniques published in the last five years.

However, there are several security issues and challenges in healthcare 5.0 which may cause the leakage or alteration of sensitive healthcare data. This demands that we need a robust framework in order to secure the data of healthcare 5.0, which can facilitate different security related procedures like authentication, access control, key management and intrusion detection. Therefore, in this review article, we propose the design of a secure generalized healthcare 5.0 framework. The details of various applications of healthcare 5.0 along with the security requirements and threat model of healthcare 5.0 are provided. Next, we discuss about the existing security mechanisms in healthcare 5.0 along with their performance comparison. Some future research directions are finally discussed for the researchers working in healthcare 5.0 domain."}

Most BLE-based mesh protocols are implemented as overlays on top of the standard Bluetooth star topologies while using piconets and scatternets. Nonetheless, mesh topology support has increased the vulnerability of BLE to security threats, since a larger number of devices can participate in a BLE Mesh network. To address these concerns, BLE version 5 enhanced existing BLE security features to deal with various authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality issues. However, there is still a lack of detailed studies related to these new security features. This survey examines the most recent BLE-based mesh network protocols and related security issues. In the first part, the latest BLE-based mesh communication protocols are discussed. The analysis shows that the implementation of BLE pure mesh protocols remains an open research issue. Moreover, there is a lack of auto-configuration mechanisms in order to support bootstrapping of BLE pure mesh networks. In the second part, recent BLE-related security issues and vulnerabilities are highlighted. Strong Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for detecting security breaches in order to protect against zero-day exploits. Nonetheless, viable IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks remain a nascent research area. Consequently, a comparative survey of IDS approaches for related low-power wireless protocols was used to map out potential approaches for enhancing IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks."}

Specifically, we propose a threat modeling framework and review the nature of cyber-physical attacks to understand their characteristics and impacts on the smart grid’s control and physical systems. We examine the existing threats detection and defense capabilities, such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs), moving target defense (MTD), and co-simulation techniques, along with discussing the impact of attacks through situational awareness and power system metrics. We discuss the human factor aspects for power system operators in analyzing the impacts of cyber-attacks. Finally, we investigate the research challenges with key research gaps to shed light on future research directions."}

These techniques have proven to be effective in detecting and mitigating cyberattacks, which can cause significant harm to individuals, organizations, and even countries. Machine learning algorithms use statistical methods to identify patterns and anomalies in large datasets, enabling security analysts to detect previously unknown threats. Deep learning, a subfield of ML, has shown great potential in improving the accuracy and efficiency of cybersecurity systems, particularly in image and speech recognition. On the other hand, RL is again a subfield of machine learning that trains algorithms to learn through trial and error, making it particularly effective in dynamic environments. We also evaluated the usage of ChatGPT-like AI tools in cyber-related problem domains on both sides, positive and negative. This article provides an overview of how ML, DL, and RL are applied in cybersecurity, including their usage in malware detection, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and other areas. The paper also specifies several research questions to provide a more comprehensive framework to investigate the efficiency of AI and ML models in the cybersecurity domain. The state-of-the-art studies using ML, DL, and RL models are evaluated in each Section based on the main idea, techniques, and important findings. It also discusses these techniques’ challenges and limitations, including data quality, interpretability, and adversarial attacks. Overall, the use of ML, DL, and RL in cybersecurity holds great promise for improving the effectiveness of security systems and enhancing our ability to protect against cyberattacks. Therefore, it is essential to continue developing and refining these techniques to address the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats. Besides, some promising solutions that rely on machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning are susceptible to adversarial attacks, underscoring the importance of factoring in this vulnerability when devising countermeasures against sophisticated cyber threats. We also concluded that ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for cybersecurity, but it should be noted that ChatGPT-like tools can also be manipulated to threaten the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data."}

A systematic review of 743 scholarly papers was conducted, from which 115 were selected for in-depth analysis. The review process involved evaluating advancements in ML techniques within the context of cybersecurity. The findings reveal that ML-driven systems significantly enhance the automation of security processes, improve the recognition of novel threats, and reduce human error in cyber threat management. However, challenges such as adversarial attacks and the need for high-quality model training pose significant barriers to the broader adoption of ML in cybersecurity. The study discusses the implications of these findings, emphasizing the necessity for developing robust and adaptive ML models that can withstand adversarial threats while improving integration across various cybersecurity applications. The insights gained from this research provide a comprehensive overview of the potential benefits and challenges of implementing ML in cybersecurity, highlighting the need for continuous innovation in threat detection mechanisms. This review acknowledges limitations such as the predominance of literature from Western contexts, potentially overlooking insights from other regions. Furthermore, the complexity of implementing ML systems in dynamic cyber environments remains a critical challenge. Future research should concentrate on refining ML algorithms to enhance resilience against adversarial threats, exploring the integration of emerging technologies for improved cybersecurity, and addressing gaps in the existing literature regarding the life cycle of ML models in real-world applications."}

They can be used for conventional data analysis. However, it is not a trivial work to identify rare behaviors or patterns out from complicated data. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of the outlier detection methods for high-dimensional data, and offer comprehensive understanding of the-state-of-the-art techniques of outlier detection for practitioners.

Deep learning is one of the exciting techniques which recently are vastly employed by the IDS or intrusion detection systems to increase their performance in securing the computer networks and hosts. This survey article focuses on the deep learning-based intrusion detection schemes and puts forward an in-depth survey and classification of these schemes. It first presents the primary background concepts about IDS architecture and various deep learning techniques. It then classifies these schemes according to the type of deep learning methods utilized in each of them. It describes how deep learning networks are utilized in the intrusion detection process to recognize intrusions accurately. Finally, a complete analysis of the investigated IDS frameworks is provided, and concluding remarks and future directions are highlighted."}

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a secondary intelligent system to monitor, detect, and alert about malicious activities; an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is an extension of a detection system that triggers relevant action when an attack is suspected in a futuristic aspect. Both IDS and IPS systems are significant and useful for developing a security model. Several studies exist to review the detection and prevention models; however, the coherence in the opportunistic or advancements in the models is missing. Besides, the existing models also have some limitations, which need to be surveyed to develop new security models. Our survey is the first one to present a study of risk factor analysis using mapping technique, and provide a proposal for hybrid framework for an efficient security model for intrusion detection and/or prevention. We explore the importance of various Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques, tools, and methods used for the detection and/or prevention systems in IoTs. More specifically, we emphasize on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for intrusion detection-prevention systems and provide a comparative analysis focusing on the feasibility, compatibility, challenges, and real-time issues. This present survey is beneficial for industry and academia to categorize the challenges and issues in the current security models and generate the new dimensions of developments of security frameworks with efficient ML or DL methods."}

Although the rise in electronics and connectivity has improved comfort, functionality, and safe driving, it has also created new attack surfaces to penetrate the in-vehicle communication network, which was initially designed as a close loop system. For such applications, the Controller Area Network (CAN) is the most-widely used communication protocol, which still suffers from various security issues because of the lack of encryption and authentication. As a result, any malicious/hijacked node can cause catastrophic accidents and financial loss. This paper analyses the CAN bus comprehensively to provide an outlook on security concerns. It also presents the security vulnerabilities of the CAN and a state-of-the-art attack surface with cases of implemented attack scenarios and goes through different solutions that assist in attack prevention, mainly based on an intrusion detection system (IDS)."}

Consequently, security issues have also been arisen with the network growth. However, intrusion detection in such big data is challenging. Smart homes, cities, grids, devices, objects, e-commerce, e-banking, e-government, etc., are different advanced applications of the evolving networks. Many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been developed recently due to most computer networks’ exposure to security and privacy threats. Data confidentiality, integrity, and availability damage will occur in case of IDS prevention failure. Conventional techniques are not effective enough to cope the advanced attacks. Advanced deep learning techniques have been proposed for automatic intrusion detection and abnormal behavior identification of networks. This research aims to provide an inclusive analysis of intrusion detection based on deep learning techniques followed by different intrusion detection systems. In this review, public network-based datasets of IDS are fully explored and analyzed. Deep learning techniques for IDS have been critically evaluated based on different performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, f-1 score, false alarm rate, and detection rate). Furthermore, existing challenges and possible solutions for networks security and privacy have been discussed."}

However, Insider Threat Detection has only recently entered the limelight. It turns out to be a daunting task, given that insiders can evade firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems, and other security mechanisms aimed at protecting the information infrastructure from outside attacks. In addition to this, some insiders having administrative rights to access privileged information and perform operations on it might turn rogue. Their malicious actions could go undetected as their digital footprint might get buried in massive dumps of log data. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the problem statement at hand, Insider Threat Detection using Deep Learning. It has been initiated by introducing Insider Threat Detection and related terminology. Deep Learning has been chosen as the preferred approach for solving this problem statement as it has been proven to be better than the conventional Machine Learning algorithms while dealing with complex data originating from varied sources. Here, Deep Learning and Log based Anomaly Detection have been explained. Some datasets available specifically for the research domain of Insider Threat Detection have been brought under one roof. Then, by having a closer look at the CERT Insider Threat Dataset, a brief comparative analysis of the existing Deep Learning solutions for Insider Threat Detection based on this dataset is provided. Also, this work overviews the challenges faced and how they open doors for further research. In order to cater to the readers looking for an industry-oriented approach, this survey explains how a Deep Learning model can be integrated with the Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana (ELK) Stack."}

However, there is a little progress in solving the secure autoconfiguration problems in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), which has led to the proliferation of threats given the vulnerabilities of MANETs. It is clear that ad hoc networks have no centralized mechanism for defense against threats, such as a firewall, an intrusion detection system, or a proxy. Therefore, it is necessary that the defense of interests of each of the ad hoc components is the responsibility of each member node.

However, most IDSs lack the capability to detect novel or previously unknown attacks. A special type of IDSs, called Anomaly Detection Systems, develop models based on normal system or network behavior, with the goal of detecting both known and unknown attacks. Anomaly detection systems face many problems including high rate of false alarm, ability to work in online mode, and scalability.

Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the “security by obscurity” principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding the outputs of these reports. While these reports show that the most exploited vulnerabilities occur due to weak boundary protection, these vulnerabilities also occur due to limited or ill-defined security policies. However, current literature focuses on intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network traffic analysis (NTA) methods, or anomaly detection techniques. Hence, finding a solution for the problems mentioned in these reports is relatively hard. We bridge this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents.

Thus, securing the data, machines (devices), and user’s privacy in cyberspace has become an utmost concern for individuals, business organizations, and national governments. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been widely employed in cybersecurity, for example, intrusion or malware detection and biometric-based user authentication. However, ML algorithms are vulnerable to attacks both in the training and testing phases, which usually leads to remarkable performance decreases and security breaches. Comparatively, limited studies have been conducted to understand the essence and degree of the vulnerabilities of ML techniques against security threats and their defensive mechanisms. It is imperative to systematize recent works related to cybersecurity using ML to seek the attention of researchers, scientists, and engineers. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the works that have been carried out most recently (from 2013 to 2018) on ML in cybersecurity, describing the basics of cyber-attacks and corresponding defenses, the basics of the most commonly used ML algorithms, and proposed ML and data mining schemes for cybersecurity in terms of features, dimensionality reduction, and classification/detection techniques. In this context, this article also provides an overview of adversarial ML, including the security characteristics of deep learning methods. Finally, open issues and challenges in cybersecurity are highlighted and potential future research directions are discussed."}

However, due to the openness, extensiveness and resource constraints of IoT, each layer of the three-tier IoT architecture suffers from a variety of security threats. In this work, we systematically review the particularity and complexity of IoT security protection, and then find that Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) can provide new powerful capabilities to meet the security requirements of IoT. We analyze the technical feasibility of AI in solving IoT security problems and summarize a general process of AI solutions for IoT security. For four serious IoT security threats: device authentication, Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks defense, intrusion detection and malware detection, we summarize representative AI solutions and compare the different algorithms and technologies used by various solutions. It should be noted that although AI provides many new capabilities for the security protection of IoT, it also brings new potential challenges and possible negative effects to IoT in terms of data, algorithm and architecture. In the future, how to solve these challenges can serve as potential research directions."}

An easy accessibility condition causes computer networks to be vulnerable against numerous and potentially devastating threats from hackers. Up to the moment, researchers have developed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) capable of detecting attacks in several available environments. A boundlessness of methods for misuse detection as well as anomaly detection has been applied. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) evolved after that to resolve am-biguities in passive network monitoring by placing detection systems on the line of attack. IPS in other words is IDS that are able to give prevention commands to firewalls and access control changes to routers. IPS can be seen as an improvement upon firewall technologies. It can make access control decisions based on application content, rather than IP address or ports as traditional firewalls do. The next innovation is the combination of IDS and IPS known as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) capable of de-tecting and preventing attacks from happening. This paper presents an overview of IDPS followed by their classifications and applications. A new signature based IDPS architecture named HawkEye Solutions has been proposed by the authors. Authors have presented the basic building blocks of the IDS, which include mechanisms for carrying out TCP port scans, Traceroute scan, ping scan and packet sniffing to monitor net-work health detect various types of attacks. Real time implementation results of the system have been pre-sented. Finally a comparative analysis of various existing IDS/IPS solutions with HawkEye Solutions em-phasizes its significance."}

In this review, we discuss several areas of cybersecurity where machine learning is used as a tool.

Unfortunately, despite impressive advantages for drivers, these functions also have various vulnerabilities that could lead to cyber-physical attacks on automotive Controller Area Networks (i.e., automotive CAN). To deal with these security issues, a multitude of issue-specific countermeasures have already been proposed. In this paper, we introduce existing research on automotive CAN attacks and evaluate several state-of-the-art countermeasures. Particularly, we provide a comprehensive adversary model for automotive CAN and classify existing countermeasures into four system categories: (1) preventative protection, (2) intrusion detection, (3) authentication, and (4) post-protection. From the extensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the security research regarding automotive CAN and identify open research directions for in-vehicle networks of autonomous vehicle."}

In the future, how to improve work efficiency while saving costs is one of the foremost research directions in wireless communications. Being able to learn from experience is an important way to approach this vision. Transfer learning (TL) encourages new tasks/domains to learn from experienced tasks/domains for helping new tasks become faster and more efficient. TL can help save energy and improve efficiency with the correlation and similarity information between different tasks in many fields of wireless communications. Therefore, applying TL to future 6G communications is a very valuable topic. TL has achieved some good results in wireless communications. In order to improve the development of TL applied in 6G communications, this article performs a comprehensive review of the TL algorithms used in different wireless communication fields, such as base stations/access points switching, indoor wireless localization and intrusion detection in wireless networks, etc. Moreover, the future research directions of mutual relationship between TL and 6G communications are discussed in detail. Challenges and future issues about integrate TL into 6G are proposed at the end. This article is intended to help readers understand the past, present, and future between TL and wireless communications."}

SMEs in these developed countries have created their own cyber regimes around AI and ML. This knowledge is tested daily in how these countries’ SMEs run their businesses and identify threats and attacks, based on the support structure of the individual country. Based on recent changes to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Brexit, and ISO standards requirements, machine learning cybersecurity (MLCS) adoption in the UK SME market has become prevalent and a good example to lean on, amongst other developed nations. Whilst MLCS has been successfully applied in many applications, including network intrusion detection systems (NIDs) worldwide, there is still a gap in the rate of adoption of MLCS techniques for UK SMEs. Other developed countries such as Spain and Australia also fall into this category, and similarities and differences to MLCS adoptions are discussed. Applications of how MLCS is applied within these SME industries are also explored. The paper investigates, using quantitative and qualitative methods, the challenges to adopting MLCS in the SME ecosystem, and how operations are managed to promote business growth. Much like security guards and policing in the real world, the virtual world is now calling on MLCS techniques to be embedded like secret service covert operations to protect data being distributed by the millions into cyberspace. This paper will use existing global research from multiple disciplines to identify gaps and opportunities for UK SME small business cyber security. This paper will also highlight barriers and reasons for low adoption rates of MLCS in SMEs and compare success stories of larger companies implementing MLCS. The methodology uses structured quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaires, distributed across an extensive participation pool directed to the SMEs’ management and technical and non-technical professionals using stratify methods. Based on the analysis and findings, this study reveals that from the primary data obtained, SMEs have the appropriate cybersecurity packages in place but are not fully aware of their potential. Secondary data collection was run in parallel to better understand how these barriers and challenges emerged, and why the rate of adoption of MLCS was very low. The paper draws the conclusion that help through government policies and processes coupled together with collaboration could minimize cyber threats in combatting hackers and malicious actors in trying to stay ahead of the game. These aspirations can be reached by ensuring that those involved have been well trained and understand the importance of communication when applying appropriate safety processes and procedures. This paper also highlights important funding gaps that could help raise cyber security awareness in the form of grants, subsidies, and financial assistance through various public sector policies and training. Lastly, SMEs’ lack of understanding of risks and impacts of cybercrime could lead to conflicting messages between cross-company IT and cybersecurity rules. Trying to find the right balance between this risk and impact, versus productivity impact and costs, could lead to UK SMES getting over these hurdles in this cyberspace in the quest for promoting the usage of MLCS. UK and Wales governments can use the research conducted in this paper to inform and adapt their policies to help UK SMEs become more secure from cyber-attacks and compare them to other developed countries also on the same future path."}

These datasets are not meant to serve as repositories for signature-based detection systems, but rather to promote research on anomaly-based detection through various machine learning approaches. CSE-CIC-IDS2018 contains about 16,000,000 instances collected over the course of ten days. It is the most recent intrusion detection dataset that is big data, publicly available, and covers a wide range of attack types. This multi-class dataset has a class imbalance, with roughly 17% of the instances comprising attack (anomalous) traffic. Our survey work contributes several key findings. We determined that the best performance scores for each study, where available, were unexpectedly high overall, which may be due to overfitting. We also found that most of the works did not address class imbalance, the effects of which can bias results in a big data study. Lastly, we discovered that information on the data cleaning of CSE-CIC-IDS2018 was inadequate across the board, a finding that may indicate problems with reproducibility of experiments. In our survey, major research gaps have also been identified."}

Unfortunately, they are known to produce large numbers of alerts that often become overwhelming for manual analysis. Therefore, aggregation methods have been developed for filtering, grouping, and correlating alerts. However, existing techniques either rely on manually defined attack scenarios or require specific alert formats, such as IDMEF that include IP addresses. This makes the application of existing aggregation methods infeasible for alerts from host-based or anomaly-based IDSs that frequently lack such network-related data. In this paper, we therefore present a domain-independent alert aggregation technique. We introduce similarity measures and merging strategies for arbitrary semi-structured alerts and alert groups. Based on these metrics and techniques we propose an incremental procedure for the generation of abstract alert patterns that enable continuous classification of incoming alerts. Evaluations show that our approach is capable of reducing the number of alert groups for human review by around \\( 80\\% \\) and assigning attack classifiers to the groups with true positive rates of \\( 80\\% \\) and false positive rates lower than \\( 5\\% \\) ."}

The so-called Internet of Things (IoT) blends the real and virtual environments and removes time and distance barriers. It is widely perceived as a major enabler for the efficient and effective provision of services across a range of sectors. It has naturally attracted the interest of cyberattackers. Due to the heterogeneity, resource-constraints, scale, and internet connectivity of IoT devices, each IoT layer is prone to various threats. Intruders consider the network layer of IoT as the gateway and leverage vulnerabilities in the routing protocol to compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of connected nodes. Researchers have proposed different security infrastructures to mitigate harm to IoT networks. One of these is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). An IDS is an essential component for the network security layer and is widely adopted to reinforce the security of the IoT network.

Datasets in this field, however, are scarce and difficult to reproduce. To compare, evaluate, and test related work, researchers usually need the same datasets or at least datasets with similar characteristics as the ones used in related work. In this work, we present concepts and the Intrusion Detection Dataset Toolkit (ID2T) to alleviate the problem of reproducing datasets with desired characteristics to enable an accurate replication of scientific results. Intrusion Detection Dataset Toolkit (ID2T) facilitates the creation of labeled datasets by injecting synthetic attacks into background traffic. The injected synthetic attacks created by ID2T blend with the background traffic by mimicking the background traffic’s properties. This article has three core contributions. First, we present a comprehensive survey on intrusion detection datasets. In the survey, we propose a classification to group the negative qualities found in the datasets. Second, the architecture of ID2T is revised, improved, and expanded in comparison to previous work. The architectural changes enable ID2T to inject recent and advanced attacks, such as the EternalBlue exploit or a peer-to-peer botnet. ID2T’s functionality provides a set of tests, known as TIDED, that helps identify potential defects in the background traffic into which attacks are injected. Third, we illustrate how ID2T is used in different use-case scenarios to replicate scientific results with the help of reproducible datasets. ID2T is open source software and is made available to the community to expand its arsenal of attacks and capabilities."}

These days, human life depends upon the smart things and their activities. Therefore, implementing protected communications in the IoT network is a challenge. Since the IoT network is secured with authentication and encryption, but not secured against cyber-attacks, an Intrusion Detection System is needed.

We explore LLM applications across various domains, including hardware design security, intrusion detection, software engineering, design verification, cyber threat intelligence, malware detection, and phishing detection. We present an overview of LLM evolution and its current state, focusing on advancements in models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x7B, BERT, Falcon2, and LLaMA. Our analysis extends to LLM vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection, insecure output handling, data poisoning, DDoS attacks, and adversarial instructions. We delve into mitigation strategies to protect these models, providing a comprehensive look at potential attack scenarios and prevention techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and hardware security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing, covering the lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research. In addition, we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs, including techniques like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing innovation and robust model deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats."}

The KDD 1999 dataset was derived from DARPA 1998 to be used by researchers in developing machine learning (ML), classification and clustering algorithms with a security focus. DARPA 1998 has been criticised in literature due to raised concerns of problems in the dataset. Many researchers have accused KDD 1999 of having similar concerns but insufficient published evidence has been found. In this paper, we review the KDD 1999 generation process and present new proofs of existing inconsistencies in KDD 1999. We then present the process used to link some of the KDD 1999 (TELNET) records back to their origins in DARPA 1998 and discuss the interesting results and findings of this experiment."}

Advanced persistence threats use continuous, clandestine, and sophisticated techniques to gain access to a system and remain hidden for a prolonged period of time, with potentially destructive consequences. Those stealthy attacks are often not detectable by advanced intrusion detection systems (e.g., LightBasin attack was detected in 2022 and has been active since 2016). Indeed, threat actors are able to quickly and intelligently alter their tactics to avoid being detected by security defense lines (e.g., prevention and detection mechanisms). In response to these evolving threats, organizations need to adopt new proactive defense approaches. Threat hunting is a proactive security line exercised to uncover stealthy attacks, malicious activities, and suspicious entities that could circumvent standard detection mechanisms. Additionally, threat hunting is an iterative approach to generate and revise threat hypotheses endeavoring to provide early attack detection in a proactive way. The proactiveness consists of testing and validating the initial hypothesis using various manual and automated tools/techniques with the objective of confirming/refuting the existence of an attack. This survey studies the threat hunting concept and provides a comprehensive review of the existing solutions for Enterprise networks. In particular, we provide a threat hunting taxonomy based on the used technique and a sub-classification based on the detailed approach. Furthermore, we discuss the existing standardization efforts. Finally, we provide a qualitative discussion on current advances and identify various research gaps and challenges that may be considered by the research community to design concrete and efficient threat hunting solutions."}

It is able to process automatically without being externally programmed thus making the process more easy, efficient, cost-effective, and reliable. ML algorithms can handle complex data more quickly and accurately. Machine Learning is used to enhance the ability of the Wireless Sensor Network environment. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is a combination of several networks and it is decentralized and distributed in nature. WSN consists of sensor nodes and sinks nodes which have a property of self-organizing and self-healing. WSN is used in other applications, such as biodiversity and ecosystem protection, surveillance, climate change tracking, and other military applications.Now-a-days, a huge development is seen in WSNs due to the advancement of electronics and wireless communication technologies, several drawbacks like low computational capacity, small memory, and limited energy resources infrastructure needs physical vulnerability to require source measures where privacy plays a key role.WSN is used to monitor the dynamic environments and to adapt to such situation sensor networks need Machine Learning techniques to avoid unnecessary redesign. Machine learning techniques survey for WSNs provide a wide range of applications in which security is given top priority. To secure data from attackers the WSNs system should be able to delete the instruction if any hackers/attackers are trying to steal data."}

With a full‐scale ZTA implementation, it is unlikely that adversaries will be able to spread through the network starting from a compromised endpoint. However, the already authenticated and authorized session of a compromised endpoint can be leveraged to carry out limited, though malicious, activities ultimately rendering the endpoints the Achilles heel of ZTA. To effectively detect such attacks, distributed collaborative intrusion detection systems with an attack scenario‐based approach have been developed. Nonetheless, advanced persistent threats have demonstrated their ability to bypass this approach with a high success ratio. As a result, adversaries can pass undetected or potentially alter the detection logging mechanisms to achieve a stealthy presence. Recently, blockchain technology has demonstrated solid use cases in the cyber security domain. In this paper, motivated by the convergence of ZTA and blockchain‐based intrusion detection and prevention, we examine how ZTA can be augmented onto endpoints. Namely, we perform a state‐of‐the‐art review of ZTA models, real‐world architectures with a focus on endpoints, and blockchain‐based intrusion detection systems. We discuss the potential of blockchain's immutability fortifying the detection process and identify open challenges as well as potential solutions and future directions."}

Significantly, IoT connects and integrates billions of devices and communication networks around the world for several real-time IoT applications. On the other hand, cybersecurity attacks on the IoT are growing at an alarming rate since these devices are vulnerable because of their limited battery life, global connectivity, resource-constrained nature, and mobility. When attacks on IoT networks go undetected within a speculated period, such security attacks may prompt severe threats and disruptive behavior inside the network and make the network unavailable to the end user. Hence, it is quintessential to design an intelligent and robust security approach that promptly detects potential attack surfaces in a dynamic IoT network. This article investigates a comprehensive survey of machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning-based intelligent intrusion detection techniques for securing IoT. Also, this article thoroughly illustrates the implementation of various categories of security threats in IoT with a neat diagram. Significantly, we classify the threats into two broad categories: 1) wireless sensor networks (WSNs) inherited security attacks and 2) routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) specific security attacks in IoT.

In smart grid computing environments, security threats have been significantly increased as shared networks are commonly used, along with the associated vulnerabilities. However, compared to other network environments, ML-based IDS research in a smart grid is relatively unexplored, although the smart grid environment is facing serious security threats due to its unique environmental vulnerabilities. In this article, we conducted an extensive survey on ML-based IDS in smart grids based on the following key aspects: (1) The applications of the ML-based IDS in transmission and distribution side power components of a smart power grid by addressing its security vulnerabilities; (2) dataset generation process and its usage in applying ML-based IDSs in the smart grid; (3) a wide range of ML-based IDSs used by the surveyed papers in the smart grid environment; (4) metrics, complexity analysis, and evaluation testbeds of the IDSs applied in the smart grid; and (5) lessons learned, insights, and future research directions."}

The development of efficient and reliable Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is an effective countermeasure against the growing cyber threats. In modern high-bandwidth, large-scale network environments, traditional IDSs suffer from a high rate of missed and false alarms. Researchers have introduced machine learning techniques into intrusion detection with good results. However, due to the scarcity of attack data, such methods’ training sets are usually unbalanced, affecting the analysis performance. In this paper, we survey and analyze the design principles and shortcomings of existing oversampling methods. Based on the findings, we take the perspective of imbalance and high dimensionality of datasets in the field of intrusion detection and propose an oversampling technique based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and feature selection. Specifically, we model the complex high-dimensional distribution of attacks based on Gradient Penalty Wasserstein GAN (WGAN-GP) to generate additional attack samples. We then select a subset of features representing the entire dataset based on analysis of variance, ultimately generating a rebalanced low-dimensional dataset for machine learning training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal, we conducted experiments based on the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS-2017 datasets. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the detection performance of machine learning models and outperform the baselines."}

Numerous algorithms have been designed to address such complex application domains. Despite an enormous array of supervised classifiers, researchers are yet to recognize a robust classification mechanism that accurately and quickly classifies the target dataset, especially in the field of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Most of the existing literature considers the accuracy and false-positive rate for assessing the performance of classification algorithms. The absence of other performance measures, such as model build time, misclassification rate, and precision, should be considered the main limitation for classifier performance evaluation. This paper’s main contribution is to analyze the current literature status in the field of network intrusion detection, highlighting the number of classifiers used, dataset size, performance outputs, inferences, and research gaps. Therefore, fifty-four state-of-the-art classifiers of various different groups, i.e., Bayes, functions, lazy, rule-based, and decision tree, have been analyzed and explored in detail, considering the sixteen most popular performance measures. This research work aims to recognize a robust classifier, which is suitable for consideration as the base learner, while designing a host-based or network-based intrusion detection system. The NSLKDD, ISCXIDS2012, and CICIDS2017 datasets have been used for training and testing purposes. Furthermore, a widespread decision-making algorithm, referred to as Techniques for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), allocated ranks to the classifiers based on observed performance reading on the concern datasets. The J48Consolidated provided the highest accuracy of 99.868%, a misclassification rate of 0.1319%, and a Kappa value of 0.998. Therefore, this classifier has been proposed as the ideal classifier for designing IDSs."}

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), using some forms of AI, have received widespread adoption due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data with a high prediction accuracy. These systems are hosted in the organizational Cyber Security Operation Center (CSoC) as a defense tool to monitor and detect malicious network flow that would otherwise impact the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). CSoC analysts rely on these systems to make decisions about the detected threats. However, IDSs designed using Deep Learning (DL) techniques are often treated as black box models and do not provide a justification for their predictions. This creates a barrier for CSoC analysts, as they are unable to improve their decisions based on the model’s predictions. One solution to this problem is to design explainable IDS (X-IDS). This survey reviews the state-of-the-art in explainable AI (XAI) for IDS, its current challenges, and discusses how these challenges span to the design of an X-IDS. In particular, we discuss black box and white box approaches comprehensively. We also present the tradeoff between these approaches in terms of their performance and ability to produce explanations. Furthermore, we propose a generic architecture that considers human-in-the-loop which can be used as a guideline when designing an X-IDS.

However, XAI-enhanced cybersecurity measures in the Internet of Things (IoT) and its sub-domains, require further investigation to provide effective discovery of attack surfaces, their corresponding vectors, and interpretable justification of model outputs. Cyber defence involves operations conducted in the cybersecurity field supporting mission objectives to identify and prevent cyberattacks using various tools and techniques, including intrusion detection systems (IDS), threat intelligence and hunting, and intrusion prevention. In cyber defence, especially anomaly-based IDS, the emerging applications of deep learning models require the interpretation of the models’ architecture and the explanation of models’ prediction to examine how cyberattacks would occur. This paper presents a comprehensive review of XAI techniques for anomaly-based intrusion detection in IoT networks. Firstly, we review IDSs focusing on anomaly-based detection techniques in IoT and how XAI models can augment them to provide trust and confidence in their detections. Secondly, we review AI models, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), for anomaly detection applications and IoT ecosystems. Moreover, we discuss DL’s ability to effectively learn from large-scale IoT datasets, accomplishing high performances in discovering and interpreting security events. Thirdly, we demonstrate recent research on the intersection of XAI, anomaly-based IDS and IoT. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and solutions of XAI for security applications in the cyber defence perspective of IoT networks, revealing future research directions. By analysing our findings, new cybersecurity applications that require XAI models emerge, assisting decision-makers in understanding and explaining security events in compromised IoT networks."}

Through IoT, these applications have consolidated in the modern world to generate, share, aggregate and analyze large amount of security-critical and privacy sensitive data. As this consolidation gets stronger, the need for security in IoT increases. With first line of defense strategies like cryptography being unsuited due to the resource constrained nature, second line of defense mechanisms are crucial to ensure security in IoT networks. This paper presents a comprehensive study of existing second line of defense mechanisms for standardized protocols in IoT networks. The paper analyzes existing mechanisms in three aspects: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and Intrusion Response Systems (IRS). We begin by providing an overview of standardized protocol stack, its layers and defensive security systems in IoT. From there, we build our narrative by presenting an extended taxonomy of IDS, IPS and IRS classifying them on their techniques, deployment, attacks, datasets, evaluation metrics and data pre-processing methods. We then thoroughly review, compare and analyze the research proposals in this context, considering the unique characteristics involved in these systems. Based on the extensive analysis of the existing defensive security systems, the paper also identifies open research challenges and directions for effective design of such systems for IoT networks, which could guide future research in the area."}

Training data mining models with system calls on a single host that has static computing and storage capacity is time-consuming, and intermediate datasets are not capable of being efficiently handled. It is cumbersome for the maintenance and updating of host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) installed on every physical or virtual host, and comprehensive system call analysis can hardly be performed to detect complex and distributed attacks among multiple hosts. Considering these limitations of current system-call-based HIDS, in this article, we provide a review of the development of system-call-based HIDS and future research trends. Algorithms and techniques relevant to system-call-based HIDS are investigated, including feature extraction methods and various data mining algorithms. The HIDS dataset issues are discussed, including currently available datasets with system calls and approaches for researchers to generate new datasets. The application of system-call-based HIDS on current embedded systems is studied, and related works are investigated. Finally, future research trends are forecast regarding three aspects, namely, the reduction of the false-positive rate, the improvement of detection efficiency, and the enhancement of collaborative security."}

Intrusion detection technology is one of the most important security solutions used today in industrial control systems to detect potential attacks and malicious activities.

Several approaches have been introduced and implemented to thwart malicious activities so far. Due to the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) methods, the proposed approach applied several ML models for the intrusion detection system. In order to evaluate the performance of models, UNSW-NB 15 and Network TON_IoT datasets were used for offline analysis. Both datasets are comparatively newer than the NSL-KDD dataset to represent modern-day attacks. However, the performance analysis was carried out by training and testing the Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the binary classification task. As the performance of IDS deteriorates with a high dimensional feature vector, an optimum set of features was selected through a Gini Impurity-based Weighted Random Forest (GIWRF) model as the embedded feature selection technique. This technique employed Gini impurity as the splitting criterion of trees and adjusted the weights for two different classes of the imbalanced data to make the learning algorithm understand the class distribution. Based upon the importance score, 20 features were selected from UNSW-NB 15 and 10 features from the Network TON_IoT dataset. The experimental result revealed that DT performed well with the feature selection technique than other trained models of this experiment. Moreover, the proposed GIWRF-DT outperformed other existing methods surveyed in the literature in terms of the F1 score."}

The IoT environment, by the application of suitable security mechanisms through efficient security management techniques, intrusion detection systems provide a wall of defence against the attacks on the Internet and on the devices connected with Internet by effective monitoring of the Internet traffic. Therefore, the intrusion detection system (IDS) is a resolution proposed by the researchers to monitor and secure the IoT communication. In this work, a meticulous analysis of the security of IoT networks based on quality-of-service metrics is performed for deploying intrusion detection systems by carrying out experiments on secured communication and measuring the network’s performance based on comparing them with the existing security metrics. Finally, we propose a new and effective IDS using a deep learning-based classification approach, namely, fuzzy CNN, for improving the security of communication. The major and foremost advantages of this system include an upsurge in detection accuracy, the accurate detection of denial of service (DoS) attacks more efficiently, and the reduction of false positive rates."}

However, the growth of the information transfer rate expands the attack surface, offering a rich environment to intruders. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widespread systems able to passively or actively control intrusive activities in a defined host and network perimeter. Recently, different IDSs have been proposed by integrating various detection techniques, generic or adapted to a specific domain and to the nature of attacks operating on. The cybersecurity landscape deals with tremendous diverse event streams that exponentially increase the attack vectors. Event stream processing (ESP) methods appear to be solutions that leverage event streams to provide actionable insights and faster detection. In this paper, we briefly describe domains (as well as their vulnerabilities) on which recent papers were-based. We also survey standards for vulnerability assessment and attack classification. Afterwards, we carry out a classification of IDSs, evaluation metrics, and datasets. Next, we provide the technical details and an evaluation of the most recent work on IDS techniques and ESP approaches covering different dimensions (axes): domains, architectures, and local communication technologies. Finally, we discuss challenges and strategies to improve IDS in terms of accuracy, performance, and robustness."}

Meanwhile, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) are one of the most important defense tools against the sophisticated and ever-growing network attacks. Due to the lack of adequate dataset, anomaly-based approaches in intrusion detection systems are suffering from accurate deployment, analysis and evaluation. There exist a number of such datasets such as DARPA98, KDD99, ISC2012, and ADFA13 that have been used by the researchers to evaluate the performance of their proposed intrusion detection and intrusion prevention approaches. Based on our study over eleven available datasets since 1998, many such datasets are out of date and unreliable to use. Some of these datasets suffer from lack of trafﬁc diversity and volumes, some of them do not cover the variety of attacks, while others anonymized packet information and payload which cannot reﬂect the current trends, or they lack feature set and metadata. This paper produces a reliable dataset that contains benign and seven common attack network ﬂows, which meets real world criteria and is publicly avaliable. Consequently, the paper evaluates the performance of a comprehensive set of network trafﬁc features and machine learning algorithms to indicate the best set of features for detecting the certain attack categories."}

To apply standard machine learning techniques, these categorical predictors are always converted to a set of binary features via one-hot encoding, making the resultant feature vector highly sparse. To learn from such sparse data effectively, it is crucial to account for the interactions between features. Factorization Machines (FMs) are a popular solution for efficiently using the second-order feature interactions. However, FM models feature interactions in a linear way, which can be insufficient for capturing the non-linear and complex inherent structure of real-world data. While deep neural networks have recently been applied to learn non-linear feature interactions in industry, such as the Wide&Deep by Google and DeepCross by Microsoft, the deep structure meanwhile makes them difficult to train. In this paper, we propose a novel model Neural Factorization Machine (NFM) for prediction under sparse settings. NFM seamlessly combines the linearity of FM in modelling second-order feature interactions and the non-linearity of neural network in modelling higher-order feature interactions. Conceptually, NFM is more expressive than FM since FM can be seen as a special case of NFM without hidden layers. Empirical results on two regression tasks show that with one hidden layer only, NFM significantly outperforms FM with a 7.3% relative improvement. Compared to the recent deep learning methods Wide&Deep and DeepCross, our NFM uses a shallower structure but offers better performance, being much easier to train and tune in practice."}

In our attempt, we present a \"learning via translation\" framework. In the baseline, we translate the labeled images from source to target domain in an unsupervised manner. We then train re-ID models with the translated images by supervised methods. Yet, being an essential part of this framework, unsupervised image-image translation suffers from the information loss of source-domain labels during translation. Our motivation is two-fold. First, for each image, the discriminative cues contained in its ID label should be maintained after translation. Second, given the fact that two domains have entirely different persons, a translated image should be dissimilar to any of the target IDs. To this end, we propose to preserve two types of unsupervised similarities, 1) self-similarity of an image before and after translation, and 2) domain-dissimilarity of a translated source image and a target image. Both constraints are implemented in the similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) which consists of an Siamese network and a CycleGAN. Through domain adaptation experiment, we show that images generated by SPGAN are more suitable for domain adaptation and yield consistent and competitive re-ID accuracy on two large-scale datasets."}

Their capability of learning complex patterns and behaviors make them a suitable solution for differentiating between normal traffic and network attacks. However, a drawback of neural networks is the amount of resources needed to train them. Many network gateways and routers devices, which could potentially host an NIDS, simply do not have the memory or processing power to train and sometimes even execute such models. More importantly, the existing neural network solutions are trained in a supervised manner. Meaning that an expert must label the network traffic and update the model manually from time to time. \nIn this paper, we present Kitsune: a plug and play NIDS which can learn to detect attacks on the local network, without supervision, and in an efficient online manner. Kitsune's core algorithm (KitNET) uses an ensemble of neural networks called autoencoders to collectively differentiate between normal and abnormal traffic patterns. KitNET is supported by a feature extraction framework which efficiently tracks the patterns of every network channel. Our evaluations show that Kitsune can detect various attacks with a performance comparable to offline anomaly detectors, even on a Raspberry PI. This demonstrates that Kitsune can be a practical and economic NIDS."}

In this paper, we explore how to model an intrusion detection system based on deep learning, and we propose a deep learning approach for intrusion detection using recurrent neural networks (RNN-IDS). Moreover, we study the performance of the model in binary classification and multiclass classification, and the number of neurons and different learning rate impacts on the performance of the proposed model. We compare it with those of J48, artificial neural network, random forest, support vector machine, and other machine learning methods proposed by previous researchers on the benchmark data set. The experimental results show that RNN-IDS is very suitable for modeling a classification model with high accuracy and that its performance is superior to that of traditional machine learning classification methods in both binary and multiclass classification. The RNN-IDS model improves the accuracy of the intrusion detection and provides a new research method for intrusion detection."}

The basics of model-free control is now employing some old functional analysis and some elementary differential algebra. The estimation techniques become quite straightforward via a recent online parameter identification approach. The importance of iPIs and especially of iPs is deduced from the presence of friction. The strange industrial ubiquity of classic PIDs and the great difficulty for tuning them in complex situations is deduced, via an elementary sampling, from their connections with iPIDs. Several numerical simulations are presented which include some infinite-dimensional systems. They demonstrate not only the power of our intelligent controllers but also the great simplicity for tuning them."}

In contrast to standard classification tasks, anomaly detection is often applied on unlabeled data, taking only the internal structure of the dataset into account. This challenge is known as unsupervised anomaly detection and is addressed in many practical applications, for example in network intrusion detection, fraud detection as well as in the life science and medical domain. Dozens of algorithms have been proposed in this area, but unfortunately the research community still lacks a comparative universal evaluation as well as common publicly available datasets. These shortcomings are addressed in this study, where 19 different unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms are evaluated on 10 different datasets from multiple application domains. By publishing the source code and the datasets, this paper aims to be a new well-funded basis for unsupervised anomaly detection research. Additionally, this evaluation reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches for the first time. Besides the anomaly detection performance, computational effort, the impact of parameter settings as well as the global/local anomaly detection behavior is outlined. As a conclusion, we give an advise on algorithm selection for typical real-world tasks."}

Yet, a serious limitation remains that all existing algorithms tend to fail when handling large-scale missing regions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a generic new approach that bridges the gap between image-conditional and recent modulated unconditional generative architectures via co-modulation of both conditional and stochastic style representations. Also, due to the lack of good quantitative metrics for image completion, we propose the new Paired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P-IDS/U-IDS), which robustly measures the perceptual fidelity of inpainted images compared to real images via linear separability in a feature space.

However, many challenges arise since malicious attacks are continually changing and are occurring in very large volumes requiring a scalable solution. There are different malware datasets available publicly for further research by cyber security community. However, no existing study has shown the detailed analysis of the performance of various machine learning algorithms on various publicly available datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of malware with continuously changing attacking methods, the malware datasets available publicly are to be updated systematically and benchmarked. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN), a type of deep learning model, is explored to develop a flexible and effective IDS to detect and classify unforeseen and unpredictable cyberattacks. The continuous change in network behavior and rapid evolution of attacks makes it necessary to evaluate various datasets which are generated over the years through static and dynamic approaches. This type of study facilitates to identify the best algorithm which can effectively work in detecting future cyberattacks. A comprehensive evaluation of experiments of DNNs and other classical machine learning classifiers are shown on various publicly available benchmark malware datasets. The optimal network parameters and network topologies for DNNs are chosen through the following hyperparameter selection methods with KDDCup 99 dataset. All the experiments of DNNs are run till 1,000 epochs with the learning rate varying in the range [0.01–0.5]. The DNN model which performed well on KDDCup 99 is applied on other datasets, such as NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, Kyoto, WSN-DS, and CICIDS 2017, to conduct the benchmark. Our DNN model learns the abstract and high-dimensional feature representation of the IDS data by passing them into many hidden layers. Through a rigorous experimental testing, it is confirmed that DNNs perform well in comparison with the classical machine learning classifiers. Finally, we propose a highly scalable and hybrid DNNs framework called scale-hybrid-IDS-AlertNet which can be used in real-time to effectively monitor the network traffic and host-level events to proactively alert possible cyberattacks."}

However, CAN bus is not enough to protect itself because of lack of security features. To detect suspicious network connections effectively, the intrusion detection system (IDS) is strongly required. Unlike the traditional IDS for Internet, there are small number of known attack signatures for vehicle networks. Also, IDS for vehicle requires high accuracy because any false-positive error can seriously affect the safety of the driver. To solve this problem, we propose a novel IDS model for in-vehicle networks, GIDS (GAN based Intrusion Detection System) using deep-learning model, Generative Adversarial Nets. GIDS can learn to detect unknown attacks using only normal data. As experiment result, GIDS shows high detection accuracy for four unknown attacks."}

Developers mainly rely on libraries and tools to add deep learning capabilities to their software. What kinds of bugs are frequently found in such software? What are the root causes of such bugs?

Understanding such characteristics of bugs in deep learning software has the potential to foster the development of better deep learning platforms, debugging mechanisms, development practices, and encourage the development of analysis and verification frameworks. Therefore, we study 2716 high-quality posts from Stack Overflow and 500 bug fix commits from Github about five popular deep learning libraries Caffe, Keras, Tensorflow, Theano, and Torch to understand the types of bugs, root causes of bugs, impacts of bugs, bug-prone stage of deep learning pipeline as well as whether there are some common antipatterns found in this buggy software. The key findings of our study include: data bug and logic bug are the most severe bug types in deep learning software appearing more than 48% of the times, major root causes of these bugs are Incorrect Model Parameter (IPS) and Structural Inefficiency (SI) showing up more than 43% of the times.We have also found that the bugs in the usage of deep learning libraries have some common antipatterns."}

To promote the research of vehicle ReID in the wild, we collect a new dataset called VERI-Wild with the following distinct features: 1) The vehicle images are captured by a large surveillance system containing 174 cameras covering a large urban district (more than 200km^2) The camera network continuously captures vehicles for 24 hours in each day and lasts for 1 month. 3) It is the first vehicle ReID dataset that is collected from unconstrained conditionsns. It is also a large dataset containing more than 400 thousand images of 40 thousand vehicle IDs. In this paper, we also propose a new method for vehicle ReID, in which, the ReID model is coupled into a Feature Distance Adversarial Network (FDA-Net), and a novel feature distance adversary scheme is designed to generate hard negative samples in feature space to facilitate ReID model training. The comprehensive results show the effectiveness of our method on the proposed dataset and the other two existing datasets."}

Specifically, the dataset has been generated using a purpose-built IoT/IIoT testbed with a large representative set of devices, sensors, protocols and cloud/edge configurations. The IoT data are generated from various IoT devices (more than 10 types) such as Low-cost digital sensors for sensing temperature and humidity, Ultrasonic sensor, Water level detection sensor, pH Sensor Meter, Soil Moisture sensor, Heart Rate Sensor, Flame Sensor, etc.). Furthermore, we identify and analyze fourteen attacks related to IoT and IIoT connectivity protocols, which are categorized into five threats, including, DoS/DDoS attacks, Information gathering, Man in the middle attacks, Injection attacks, and Malware attacks. In addition, we extract features obtained from different sources, including alerts, system resources, logs, network traffic, and propose new 61 features with high correlations from 1176 found features. After processing and analyzing the proposed realistic cyber security dataset, we provide a primary exploratory data analysis and evaluate the performance of machine learning approaches (i.e., traditional machine learning as well as deep learning) in both centralized and federated learning modes.

However, existing per-sonalized generation methods cannot simultaneously sat-isfy the requirements of high efficiency, promising identity (ID) fidelity, and flexible text controllability. In this work, we introduce PhotoMaker, an efficient personalized text-to-image generation method, which mainly encodes an arbitrary number of input ID images into a stack ID embed-ding for preserving ID information. Such an embedding, serving as a unified ID representation, can not only encap-sulate the characteristics of the same input ID comprehen-sively, but also accommodate the characteristics of differ-ent IDs for subsequent integration. This paves the way for more intriguing and practically valuable applications. Be-sides, to drive the training of our PhotoMaker, we propose an ID-oriented data construction pipeline to assemble the training data. Under the nourishment of the dataset constructed through the proposed pipeline, our PhotoMaker demonstrates better ID preservation ability than test-time fine-tuning based methods, yet provides significant speed improvements, high-quality generation results, strong gen-eralization capabilities, and a wide range of applications."}

An alternative involves using pagination, because the often large page numbers in scientific journals, in combination with other fields, can serve as a type of unique identifier. However, this is complicated by variations in the way page numbers are stored. Most biomedical databases use a long format (e.g., 1008–1012), but two important databases (MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library) use an abbreviated one (e.g., 1008–12)."}

However, most existing grey-box fuzzers lack directedness, i.e. the capability of executing towards user-specified target sites in the program. To emphasize existing challenges in directed fuzzing, we propose Hawkeye to feature four desired properties of directed grey-box fuzzers. Owing to a novel static analysis on the program under test and the target sites, Hawkeye precisely collects the information such as the call graph, function and basic block level distances to the targets. During fuzzing, Hawkeye evaluates exercised seeds based on both static information and the execution traces to generate the dynamic metrics, which are then used for seed prioritization, power scheduling and adaptive mutating. These strategies help Hawkeye to achieve better directedness and gravitate towards the target sites. We implemented Hawkeye as a fuzzing framework and evaluated it on various real-world programs under different scenarios. The experimental results showed that Hawkeye can reach the target sites and reproduce the crashes much faster than state-of-the-art grey-box fuzzers such as AFL and AFLGo. Specially, Hawkeye can reduce the time to exposure for certain vulnerabilities from about 3.5 hours to 0.5 hour. By now, Hawkeye has detected more than 41 previously unknown crashes in projects such as Oniguruma, MJS with the target sites provided by vulnerability prediction tools; all these crashes are confirmed and 15 of them have been assigned CVE IDs."}

Many of these devices are, however, vulnerable due to insecure design, implementation, and configuration. As a result, many networks already have vulnerable IoT devices that are easy to compromise. This has led to a new category of malware specifically targeting IoT devices. However, existing intrusion detection techniques are not effective in detecting compromised IoT devices given the massive scale of the problem in terms of the number of different types of devices and manufacturers involved. In this paper, we present DÏoT, an autonomous self-learning distributed system for detecting compromised IoT devices. DÏoT builds effectively on device-type-specific communication profiles without human intervention nor labeled data that are subsequently used to detect anomalous deviations in devices' communication behavior, potentially caused by malicious adversaries. DÏoT utilizes a federated learning approach for aggregating behavior profiles efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a federated learning approach to anomaly-detection-based intrusion detection. Consequently, DÏoT can cope with emerging new and unknown attacks. We systematically and extensively evaluated more than 30 off-the-shelf IoT devices over a long term and show that DÏoT is highly effective (95.6% detection rate) and fast (257 ms) at detecting devices compromised by, for instance, the infamous Mirai malware. DÏoT reported no false alarms when evaluated in a real-world smart home deployment setting."}

The potential threats to IoT applications and the need to reduce risk have recently become an interesting research topic. It is crucial that effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) tailored to IoT applications be developed. Such IDSs require an updated and representative IoT dataset for training and evaluation. However, there is a lack of benchmark IoT and IIoT datasets for assessing IDSs-enabled IoT systems. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a new data-driven IoT/IIoT dataset with the ground truth that incorporates a label feature indicating normal and attack classes, as well as a type feature indicating the sub-classes of attacks targeting IoT/IIoT applications for multi-classification problems. The proposed dataset, which is named TON_IoT, includes Telemetry data of IoT/IIoT services, as well as Operating Systems logs and Network traffic of IoT network, collected from a realistic representation of a medium-scale network at the Cyber Range and IoT Labs at the UNSW Canberra (Australia). This paper also describes the proposed dataset of the Telemetry data of IoT/IIoT services and their characteristics. TON_IoT has various advantages that are currently lacking in the state-of-the-art datasets: i) it has various normal and attack events for different IoT/IIoT services, and ii) it includes heterogeneous data sources. We evaluated the performance of several popular Machine Learning (ML) methods and a Deep Learning model in both binary and multi-class classification problems for intrusion detection purposes using the proposed Telemetry dataset."}

In this work, we theoretically analyze the upper limit of model parallelism in face recognition in the first place. Then we propose a load-balanced sparse distributed classification training method, Partial FC, which is capable of using a machine with only 8 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs to implement training on a face recognition data set with up to 29 million IDs. Furthermore, we are able to train on data set with 100 million IDs in 64 RTX2080Ti GPUs. We have verified the effectiveness of Partial FC in 8 mainstream face recognition trainsets, and find that Partial FC is effective in all face recognition training sets.

This system, referred to as DP3T, provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by simplifying and accelerating the process of notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures to break its transmission chain. The system aims to minimise privacy and security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level of data protection. The goal of our proximity tracing system is to determine who has been in close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the virus, without revealing the contact's identity or where the contact occurred. To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user's phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close proximity. When a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server. Prior to the upload, all data remains exclusively on the user's phone. Other users' apps can use data from the server to locally estimate whether the device's owner was exposed to the virus through close-range physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person who has uploaded their data. In case the app detects a high risk, it will inform the user."}

Yet, these models are vulnerable to a class of malicious inputs known as adversarial examples. These are slightly perturbed inputs that are classified incorrectly by the ML model. The mitigation of these adversarial inputs remains an open problem. As a step towards understanding adversarial examples, we show that they are not drawn from the same distribution than the original data, and can thus be detected using statistical tests. Using thus knowledge, we introduce a complimentary approach to identify specific inputs that are adversarial. Specifically, we augment our ML model with an additional output, in which the model is trained to classify all adversarial inputs. We evaluate our approach on multiple adversarial example crafting methods (including the fast gradient sign and saliency map methods) with several datasets. The statistical test flags sample sets containing adversarial inputs confidently at sample sizes between 10 and 100 data points. Furthermore, our augmented model either detects adversarial examples as outliers with high accuracy (> 80%) or increases the adversary's cost - the perturbation added - by more than 150%. In this way, we show that statistical properties of adversarial examples are essential to their detection."}

These softwares generate alerts which must be investigated by cyber analysts to ﬁgure out if they are true attacks. Unfortunately, in practice, there are more alerts than cyber analysts can properly investigate. This leads to a “threat alert fatigue” or information overload problem where cyber analysts miss true attack alerts in the noise of false alarms. In this paper, we present N O D OZE to combat this challenge using contextual and historical information of generated threat alert. N O D OZE ﬁrst generates a causal dependency graph of an alert event. Then, it assigns an anomaly score to each edge in the dependency graph based on the frequency with which related events have happened before in the enterprise. N O D OZE then propagates those scores along the neighboring edges of the graph using a novel network diffusion algorithm and generates an aggregate anomaly score which is used for triaging. We deployed and evaluated N O D OZE at NEC Labs America. Evaluation on our dataset of 364 threat alerts shows that N O D OZE consistently ranked the true alerts higher than the false alerts based on aggregate anomaly scores. Further, through the introduction of a cutoff threshold for anomaly scores, we estimate that our system decreases the volume of false alarms by 84%, saving analysts’ more than 90 hours of investigation time per week. N O D OZE generates alert dependency graphs that are two orders of magnitude smaller than those generated by traditional tools without sacriﬁcing the vital information needed for the investigation. Our system has a low average runtime overhead and can be deployed with any threat detection software."}

Because some vehicles commonly share same model and maker, it is hard to distinguish them based on their global appearances. Compared with the global appearance, local regions such as decorations and inspection stickers attached to the windshield, may be more distinctive for vehicle Re-ID. To embed the detailed visual cues in those local regions, we propose a Region-Aware deep Model (RAM). Specifically, in addition to extracting global features, RAM also extracts features from a series of local regions. As each local region conveys more distinctive visual cues, RAM encourages the deep model to learn discriminative features. We also introduce a novel learning algorithm to jointly use vehicle IDs, types/models, and colors to train the RAM. This strategy fuses more cues for training and results in more discriminative global and regional features. We evaluate our methods on two large-scale vehicle Re-ID datasets, i.e., VeRi and VehicleID. Experimental results show our methods achieve promising performance in comparison with recent works."}

As a result, many novel attacks are being generated and have posed challenges for network security to accurately detect intrusions. Furthermore, the presence of the intruders with the aim to launch various attacks within the network cannot be ignored. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one such tool that prevents the network from possible intrusions by inspecting the network traffic, to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Despite enormous efforts by the researchers, IDS still faces challenges in improving detection accuracy while reducing false alarm rates and in detecting novel intrusions. Recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)‐based IDS systems are being deployed as potential solutions to detect intrusions across the network in an efficient manner. This article first clarifies the concept of IDS and then provides the taxonomy based on the notable ML and DL techniques adopted in designing network‐based IDS (NIDS) systems. A comprehensive review of the recent NIDS‐based articles is provided by discussing the strengths and limitations of the proposed solutions. Then, recent trends and advancements of ML and DL‐based NIDS are provided in terms of the proposed methodology, evaluation metrics, and dataset selection. Using the shortcomings of the proposed methods, we highlighted various research challenges and provided the future scope for the research in improving ML and DL‐based NIDS."}

In these tasks, user and item IDs are important identifiers for personalization. Transformer, which is demonstrated with strong language modeling capability, however, is not personalized and fails to make use of the user and item IDs since the ID tokens are not even in the same semantic space as the words. To address this problem, we present a PErsonalized Transformer for Explainable Recommendation (PETER), on which we design a simple and effective learning objective that utilizes the IDs to predict the words in the target explanation, so as to endow the IDs with linguistic meanings and to achieve personalized Transformer. Besides generating explanations, PETER can also make recommendations, which makes it a unified model for the whole recommendation-explanation pipeline. Extensive experiments show that our small unpretrained model outperforms fine-tuned BERT on the generation task, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, which highlights the importance and the nice utility of our design."}

Most existing SRL methods rely on explicit item IDs for developing the sequence models to better capture user preference. Though effective to some extent, these methods are difficult to be transferred to new recommendation scenarios, due to the limitation by explicitly modeling item IDs. To tackle this issue, we present a novel universal sequence representation learning approach, named UniSRec. The proposed approach utilizes the associated description text of items to learn transferable representations across different recommendation scenarios. For learning universal item representations, we design a lightweight item encoding architecture based on parametric whitening and mixture-of-experts enhanced adaptor. For learning universal sequence representations, we introduce two contrastive pre-training tasks by sampling multi-domain negatives. With the pre-trained universal sequence representation model, our approach can be effectively transferred to new recommendation domains or platforms in a parameter-efficient way, under either inductive or transductive settings. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Especially, our approach also leads to a performance improvement in a cross-platform setting, showing the strong transferability of the proposed universal SRL method.

As this adversarial scenario is not taken into account by classical design methods, pattern classification systems may exhibit vulnerabilities, whose exploitation may severely affect their performance, and consequently limit their practical utility. Extending pattern classification theory and design methods to adversarial settings is thus a novel and very relevant research direction, which has not yet been pursued in a systematic way. In this paper, we address one of the main open issues: evaluating at design phase the security of pattern classifiers, namely, the performance degradation under potential attacks they may incur during operation. We propose a framework for empirical evaluation of classifier security that formalizes and generalizes the main ideas proposed in the literature, and give examples of its use in three real applications. Reported results show that security evaluation can provide a more complete understanding of the classifier's behavior in adversarial environments, and lead to better design choices."}

In this paper, we propose and explore a new video extension of this task, called video panoptic segmentation. The task requires generating consistent panoptic segmentation as well as an association of instance ids across video frames. To invigorate research on this new task, we present two types of video panoptic datasets. The first is a re-organization of the synthetic VIPER dataset into the video panoptic format to exploit its large-scale pixel annotations. The second is a temporal extension on the Cityscapes val. set, by providing new video panoptic annotations (Cityscapes-VPS). Moreover, we propose a novel video panoptic segmentation network (VPSNet) which jointly predicts object classes, bounding boxes, masks, instance id tracking, and semantic segmentation in video frames. To provide appropriate metrics for this task, we propose a video panoptic quality (VPQ) metric and evaluate our method and several other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented two datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results in image PQ on Cityscapes and also in VPQ on Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets."}

However, most existing methods neglect the complex cross-modality interactions between network structure and node attribute. In this paper, we propose a deep joint representation learning framework for anomaly detection through a dual autoencoder (AnomalyDAE), which captures the complex interactions between network structure and node attribute for high-quality embeddings. Specifically, Anoma-lyDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an attribute autoencoder to learn both node embedding and attribute embedding jointly in latent space. Moreover, attention mechanism is employed in structure encoder to learn the importance between a node and its neighbors for an effective capturing of structure pattern, which is important to anomaly detection. Besides, by taking both the node embedding and attribute embedding as inputs of attribute decoder, the cross-modality interactions between network structure and node attribute are learned during the reconstruction of node attribute. Finally, anomalies can be detected by measuring the reconstruction errors of nodes from both the structure and attribute perspectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

GNNs are a relatively new sub-field of deep neural networks, which can leverage the inherent structure of graph-based data. Training and evaluation data for NIDSs are typically represented as flow records, which can naturally be represented in a graph format. In this paper, we propose E-GraphSAGE, a GNN approach that allows capturing both the edge features of a graph as well as the topological information for network intrusion detection in IoT networks. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first successful, practical, and extensively evaluated approach of applying GNNs on the problem of network intrusion detection for IoT using flow-based data. Our extensive experimental evaluation on four recent NIDS benchmark datasets shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of key classification metrics, which demonstrates the potential of GNNs in network intrusion detection, and provides motivation for further research."}

An intrusion detection system (IDS) which is an important cyber security technique, monitors the state of software and hardware running in the network. Despite decades of development, existing IDSs still face challenges in improving the detection accuracy, reducing the false alarm rate and detecting unknown attacks. To solve the above problems, many researchers have focused on developing IDSs that capitalize on machine learning methods. Machine learning methods can automatically discover the essential differences between normal data and abnormal data with high accuracy. In addition, machine learning methods have strong generalizability, so they are also able to detect unknown attacks. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, whose performance is remarkable and has become a research hotspot. This survey proposes a taxonomy of IDS that takes data objects as the main dimension to classify and summarize machine learning-based and deep learning-based IDS literature. We believe that this type of taxonomy framework is fit for cyber security researchers. The survey first clarifies the concept and taxonomy of IDSs. Then, the machine learning algorithms frequently used in IDSs, metrics, and benchmark datasets are introduced. Next, combined with the representative literature, we take the proposed taxonomic system as a baseline and explain how to solve key IDS issues with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Finally, challenges and future developments are discussed by reviewing recent representative studies."}

Due to the complex and time-varying network environment, the network intrusion samples are submerged into a large number of normal samples, which leads to insufficient samples for model training and detection results with a high false detection rate. According to the problem of data imbalance, we propose a network intrusion detection algorithm combined hybrid sampling with deep hierarchical network. Firstly, we use the one-side selection (OSS) to reduce the noise samples in majority category, and then increase the minority samples by Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). In this way, a balanced dataset can be established to make the model fully learn the features of minority samples and greatly reduce the model training time. Secondly, we use convolution neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to extract temporal features, which forms a deep hierarchical network model. The proposed network intrusion detection algorithm was verified by experiments on the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 dataset, and the classification accuracy can achieve 83.58% and 77.16%, respectively."}

Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intravehicle and external networks due to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this article, the vulnerabilities of intravehicle and external networks are discussed, and a multitiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the IVN data and 99.88% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 data set illustrating the external vehicular network data. For the zero-day attack detection, the proposed system achieves high F1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two data sets, respectively. The average processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less than 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in real-time vehicle systems. This emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed IDS."}

The state-of-the-art research work performed vehicle Re-ID relying on deep metric learning with a triplet network. However, most existing methods basically ignore the impact of intraclass variance-incorporated embedding on the performance of vehicle reidentification, in which robust fine-grained features for large-scale vehicle Re-ID have not been fully studied. In this paper, we propose a deep metric learning method, group-sensitive-triplet embedding (GS-TRE), to recognize and retrieve vehicles, in which intraclass variance is elegantly modeled by incorporating an intermediate representation “group” between samples and each individual vehicle in the triplet network learning. To capture the intraclass variance attributes of each individual vehicle, we utilize an online grouping method to partition samples within each vehicle ID into a few groups, and build up the triplet samples at multiple granularities across different vehicle IDs as well as different groups within the same vehicle ID to learn fine-grained features. In particular, we construct a large-scale vehicle database “PKU-Vehicle,” consisting of 10 million vehicle images captured by different surveillance cameras in several cities, to evaluate the vehicle Re-ID performance in real-world video surveillance applications. Extensive experiments over benchmark datasets VehicleID, VeRI, and CompCar have shown that the proposed GS-TRE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for vehicle Re-ID."}

They handle the click incompleteness bias, but usually assume that the clicks are noise-free, i.e., a clicked document is always assumed to be relevant. In this paper, we relax this unrealistic assumption and study click noise explicitly in the unbiased learning-to-rank setting. Specifically, we model the noise as the position-dependent trust bias and propose a noise-aware Position-Based Model, named TrustPBM, to better capture user click behavior. We propose an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate both examination and trust bias from click data in TrustPBM. Furthermore, we show that it is difficult to use a pure IPS method to incorporate click noise and thus propose a novel method that combines a Bayes rule application with IPS for unbiased learning-to-rank. We evaluate our proposed methods on three personal search data sets and demonstrate that our proposed model can significantly outperform the existing unbiased learning-to-rank methods."}

We consider the general (agnostic) setting without access to a consistent model of rewards and establish a minimax lower bound on the mean squared error (MSE). The bound is matched up to constants by the inverse propensity scoring (IPS) and doubly robust (DR) estimators. This highlights the difficulty of the agnostic contextual setting, in contrast with multi-armed bandits and contextual bandits with access to a consistent reward model, where IPS is suboptimal. We then propose the SWITCH estimator, which can use an existing reward model (not necessarily consistent) to achieve a better bias-variance tradeoff than IPS and DR. We prove an upper bound on its MSE and demonstrate its benefits empirically on a diverse collection of data sets, often outperforming prior work by orders of magnitude."}

Nowadays, with the help of machine learning algorithms, the intrusion detection system develops rapidly. However, the robustness of this system is questionable when it faces the adversarial attacks. To improve the detection system, more potential attack approaches should be researched. In this paper, a framework of the generative adversarial networks, IDSGAN, is proposed to generate the adversarial attacks, which can deceive and evade the intrusion detection system. Considering that the internal structure of the detection system is unknown to attackers, adversarial attack examples perform the black-box attacks against the detection system. IDSGAN leverages a generator to transform original malicious traffic into adversarial malicious traffic. A discriminator classifies traffic examples and simulates the black-box detection system. More significantly, we only modify part of the attacks' nonfunctional features to guarantee the validity of the intrusion. Based on the dataset NSL-KDD, the feasibility of the model is demonstrated to attack many detection systems with different attacks and the excellent results are achieved. Moreover, the robustness of IDSGAN is verified by changing the amount of the unmodified features."}

In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems, and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against IoT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client–server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP, and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely decision tree, Naive Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network, to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors’ data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques."}

However, the performance of these systems decreases for high dimensional data spaces. Therefore, it is crucial to implement an appropriate feature extraction method that can prune some of the features that do not possess a great impact in the classification process. Moreover, many of the ML based IDSs suffer from an increase in false positive rate and a low detection accuracy when the models are trained on highly imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we present an analysis the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection dataset that will be used for training and testing our models. Moreover, we apply a filter-based feature reduction technique using the XGBoost algorithm. We then implement the following ML approaches using the reduced feature space: Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest-Neighbour (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision Tree (DT). In our experiments, we considered both the binary and multiclass classification configurations. The results demonstrated that the XGBoost-based feature selection method allows for methods such as the DT to increase its test accuracy from 88.13 to 90.85% for the binary classification scheme."}

Recent work uses a standard tracking-by-detection pipeline, where feature extraction is first performed independently for each object in order to compute an affinity matrix. Then the affinity matrix is passed to the Hungarian algorithm for data association. A key process of this standard pipeline is to learn discriminative features for different objects in order to reduce confusion during data association. In this work, we propose two techniques to improve the discriminative feature learning for MOT: (1) instead of obtaining features for each object independently, we propose a novel feature interaction mechanism by introducing the Graph Neural Network. As a result, the feature of one object is informed of the features of other objects so that the object feature can lean towards the object with similar feature (i.e., object probably with a same ID) and deviate from objects with dissimilar features (i.e., object probably with different IDs), leading to a more discriminative feature for each object; (2) instead of obtaining the feature from either 2D or 3D space in prior work, we propose a novel joint feature extractor to learn appearance and motion features from 2D and 3D space simultaneously. As features from different modalities often have complementary information, the joint feature can be more discriminate than feature from each individual modality. To ensure that the joint feature extractor does not heavily rely on one modality, we also propose an ensemble training paradigm. Through extensive evaluation, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and nuScenes 3D MOT benchmarks.

However, there exists a large semantic gap between LLMs and recommender systems, since items to be recommended are often indexed by discrete identifiers (item ID) out of the LLM's vocabulary. In essence, LLMs capture language semantics while recommender systems imply collaborative semantics, making it difficult to sufficiently leverage the model capacity of LLMs for recommendation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new LLM-based recommendation model called LC-Rec, which can better integrate language and collaborative semantics for recommender systems. Our approach can directly generate items from the entire item set for recommendation, without relying on candidate items. Specifically, we make two major contributions in our approach. For item indexing, we design a learning-based vector quantization method with uniform semantic mapping, which can assign meaningful and non-conflicting IDs (called item indices) for items. For alignment tuning, we propose a series of specially designed tuning tasks to enhance the integration of collaborative semantics in LLMs. Our fine-tuning tasks enforce LLMs to deeply integrate language and collaborative semantics (characterized by the learned item indices), so as to achieve an effective adaptation to recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing that our approach can outperform a number of competitive baselines including traditional recommenders and existing LLM-based recommenders.

An IDS learns normal and anomalous behavior by analyzing network traffic and can detect unknown and new attacks. However, the performance of an IDS is highly dependent on feature design, and designing a feature set that can accurately characterize network traffic is still an ongoing research issue. Anomaly-based IDSs also have the problem of a high false alarm rate (FAR), which seriously restricts their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel IDS called the hierarchical spatial-temporal features-based intrusion detection system (HAST-IDS), which first learns the low-level spatial features of network traffic using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and then learns high-level temporal features using long short-term memory networks. The entire process of feature learning is completed by the deep neural networks automatically; no feature engineering techniques are required. The automatically learned traffic features effectively reduce the FAR. The standard DARPA1998 and ISCX2012 data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The experimental results show that the HAST-IDS outperforms other published approaches in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and FAR, which successfully demonstrates its effectiveness in both feature learning and FAR reduction."}

However, in the long-term re-ID scenario, a person has a great chance to change clothes. A sophisticated re-ID system should take such changes into account. To facilitate the study of long-term re-ID, this paper introduces a large-scale re-ID dataset called “Celeb-reID” to the community. Unlike previous datasets, the same person can change clothes in the proposed Celeb-reID dataset. Images of Celeb-reID are acquired from the Internet using street snap-shots of celebrities. There is a total of 1,052 IDs with 34,186 images making Celeb-reID being the largest long-term re-ID dataset so far. To tackle the challenge of cloth changes, we propose to use vector-neuron (VN) capsules instead of the traditional scalar neurons (SN) to design our network. Compared with SN, one extra-dimensional information in VN can perceive cloth changes of the same person. We introduce a well-designed ReIDCaps network and integrate capsules to deal with the person re-ID task. Soft Embedding Attention (SEA) and Feature Sparse Representation (FSR) mechanisms are adopted in our network for performance boosting. Experiments are conducted on the proposed long-term re-ID dataset and two common short-term re-ID datasets. Comprehensive analyses are given to demonstrate the challenge exposed in our datasets. Experimental results show that our ReIDCaps can outperform existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the long-term scenario. The new dataset and code will be released to facilitate future researches."}

This work shows that modern LLMs are vulnerable to option position changes in MCQs due to their inherent\"selection bias\", namely, they prefer to select specific option IDs as answers (like\"Option A\"). Through extensive empirical analyses with 20 LLMs on three benchmarks, we pinpoint that this behavioral bias primarily stems from LLMs' token bias, where the model a priori assigns more probabilistic mass to specific option ID tokens (e.g., A/B/C/D) when predicting answers from the option IDs. To mitigate selection bias, we propose a label-free, inference-time debiasing method, called PriDe, which separates the model's prior bias for option IDs from the overall prediction distribution. PriDe first estimates the prior by permutating option contents on a small number of test samples, and then applies the estimated prior to debias the remaining samples. We demonstrate that it achieves interpretable and transferable debiasing with high computational efficiency. We hope this work can draw broader research attention to the bias and robustness of modern LLMs."}

The 2016 Dyn cyberattack exposed the critical fault-lines among smart networks. Security of IoT has become a critical concern. The danger exposed by infested Internet-connected Things not only affects the security of IoT but also threatens the complete Internet eco-system which can possibly exploit the vulnerable Things (smart devices) deployed as botnets. Mirai malware compromised the video surveillance devices and paralyzed Internet via distributed denial of service attacks. In the recent past, security attack vectors have evolved bothways, in terms of complexity and diversity. Hence, to identify and prevent or detect novel attacks, it is important to analyze techniques in IoT context. This survey classifies the IoT security threats and challenges for IoT networks by evaluating existing defense techniques. Our main focus is on network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs); hence, this paper reviews existing NIDS implementation tools and datasets as well as free and open-source network sniffing software. Then, it surveys, analyzes, and compares state-of-the-art NIDS proposals in the IoT context in terms of architecture, detection methodologies, validation strategies, treated threats, and algorithm deployments. The review deals with both traditional and machine learning (ML) NIDS techniques and discusses future directions. In this survey, our focus is on IoT NIDS deployed via ML since learning algorithms have a good success rate in security and privacy. The survey provides a comprehensive review of NIDSs deploying different aspects of learning techniques for IoT, unlike other top surveys targeting the traditional systems.

Recently, a lot of research effort has been dedicated to the development of Machine Learning (ML) based NIDSs. As in any ML-based application, the availability of high-quality datasets is critical for the training and evaluation of ML-based NIDS. One of the key problems with the currently available NIDS datasets is the lack of a standard feature set. The use of a unique and proprietary set of features for each of the publicly available datasets makes it virtually impossible to compare the performance of ML-based traffic classifiers on different datasets, and hence to evaluate the ability of these systems to generalise across different network scenarios. To address that limitation, this paper proposes and evaluates standard NIDS feature sets based on the NetFlow network meta-data collection protocol and system. We evaluate and compare two NetFlow-based feature set variants, a version with 12 features, and another one with 43 features. For our evaluation, we converted four widely used NIDS datasets (UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, ToN-IoT, CSE-CIC-IDS2018) into new variants with our proposed NetFlow based feature sets. Based on an Extra Tree classifier, we compared the classification performance of the NetFlow-based feature sets with the proprietary feature sets provided with the original datasets. While the smaller feature set cannot match the classification performance of the proprietary feature sets, the larger set with 43 NetFlow features, surprisingly achieves a consistently higher classification performance compared to the original feature set, which was tailored to each of the considered NIDS datasets. The proposed NetFlow-based NIDS feature set, together with four benchmark datasets, made available to the research community, allow a fair comparison of ML-based network traffic classifiers across different NIDS datasets. We believe that having a standard feature set is critical for allowing a more rigorous and thorough evaluation of ML-based NIDSs and that it can help bridge the gap between academic research and the practical deployment of such systems."}

Over the past few decades, research on anomaly mining has received increasing interests due to the implications of these occurrences in a wide range of disciplines - for instance, security, finance, and medicine. For this reason, anomaly detection, which aims to identify these rare observations, has become one of the most vital tasks in the world and has shown its power in preventing detrimental events, such as financial fraud, network intrusions, and social spam. The detection task is typically solved by identifying outlying data points in the feature space, which, inherently, overlooks the relational information in real-world data. At the same time, graphs have been prevalently used to represent the structural/relational information, which raises the graph anomaly detection problem - identifying anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and sub-graphs) in a single graph, or anomalous graphs in a set/database of graphs. Conventional anomaly detection techniques cannot tackle this problem well because of the complexity of graph data (e.g., irregular structures, relational dependencies, node/edge types/attributes/directions/multiplicities/weights, large scale, etc.). However, thanks to the advent of deep learning in breaking these limitations, graph anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention recently. In this survey, we aim to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the contemporary deep learning techniques for graph anomaly detection. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy that follows a task-driven strategy and categorizes existing work according to the anomalous graph objects that they can detect. We especially focus on the challenges in this research area and discuss the key intuitions, technical details as well as relative strengths and weaknesses of various techniques in each category. From the survey results, we highlight 12 future research directions spanning unsolved and emerging problems introduced by graph data, anomaly detection, deep learning and real-world applications. Additionally, to provide a wealth of useful resources for future studies, we have compiled a set of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics. With this survey, our goal is to create a “one-stop-shop” that provides a unified understanding of the problem categories and existing approaches, publicly available hands-on resources, and high-impact open challenges for graph anomaly detection using deep learning."}

To this end, several surveys were put forward addressing various IoT-centric topics, including intrusion detection systems, threat modeling, and emerging technologies. In contrast, in this paper, we exclusively focus on the ever-evolving IoT vulnerabilities. In this context, we initially provide a comprehensive classification of state-of-the-art surveys, which address various dimensions of the IoT paradigm. This aims at facilitating IoT research endeavors by amalgamating, comparing, and contrasting dispersed research contributions. Subsequently, we provide a unique taxonomy, which sheds the light on IoT vulnerabilities, their attack vectors, impacts on numerous security objectives, attacks which exploit such vulnerabilities, corresponding remediation methodologies and currently offered operational cyber security capabilities to infer and monitor such weaknesses. This aims at providing the reader with a multidimensional research perspective related to IoT vulnerabilities, including their technical details and consequences, which is postulated to be leveraged for remediation objectives. Additionally, motivated by the lack of empirical (and malicious) data related to the IoT paradigm, this paper also presents a first look on Internet-scale IoT exploitations by drawing upon more than 1.2 GB of macroscopic, passive measurements’ data. This aims at practically highlighting the severity of the IoT problem, while providing operational situational awareness capabilities, which undoubtedly would aid in the mitigation task, at large. Insightful findings, inferences and outcomes in addition to open challenges and research problems are also disclosed in this paper, which we hope would pave the way for future research endeavors addressing theoretical and empirical aspects related to the imperative topic of IoT security."}

Most successful UDA-ReID approaches combine clustering-based pseudo-label prediction with representation learning and perform the two steps in an alternating fashion. However, offline interaction between these two steps may allow noisy pseudo labels to substantially hinder the capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a Group-aware Label Transfer (GLT) algorithm, which enables the online interaction and mutual promotion of pseudo-label prediction and representation learning. Specifically, a label transfer algorithm simultaneously uses pseudo labels to train the data while refining the pseudo labels as an online clustering algorithm. It treats the online label refinery problem as an optimal transport problem, which explores the minimum cost for assigning M samples to N pseudo labels. More importantly, we introduce a group-aware strategy to assign implicit attribute group IDs to samples. The combination of the online label refining algorithm and the group-aware strategy can better correct the noisy pseudo label in an online fashion and narrow down the search space of the target identity. The effectiveness of the proposed GLT is demonstrated by the experimental results (Rank-1 accuracy) for Market1501→DukeMTMC (82.0%) and DukeMTMC→Market1501 (92.2%), remarkably closing the gap between unsupervised and supervised performance on person re-identification. 1"}

To that end, we create semantically meaningful tuple of codewords to serve as a Semantic ID for each item. Given Semantic IDs for items in a user session, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model is trained to predict the Semantic ID of the next item that the user will interact with. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Semantic ID-based generative model for recommendation tasks. We show that recommender systems trained with the proposed paradigm significantly outperform the current SOTA models on various datasets. In addition, we show that incorporating Semantic IDs into the sequence-to-sequence model enhances its ability to generalize, as evidenced by the improved retrieval performance observed for items with no prior interaction history."}

Unfortunately, this vision hasn't come to fruition: in fact, developing and maintaining today's security machine learning systems can require engineering resources that are comparable to that of signature-based detection systems, due in part to the need to develop and continuously tune the \"features\" these machine learning systems look at as attacks evolve. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, promises to change this by operating on raw input signals and automating the process of feature design and extraction. In this paper we propose the eXpose neural network, which uses a deep learning approach we have developed to take generic, raw short character strings as input (a common case for security inputs, which include artifacts like potentially malicious URLs, file paths, named pipes, named mutexes, and registry keys), and learns to simultaneously extract features and classify using character-level embeddings and convolutional neural network. In addition to completely automating the feature design and extraction process, eXpose outperforms manual feature extraction based baselines on all of the intrusion detection problems we tested it on, yielding a 5%-10% detection rate gain at 0.1% false positive rate compared to these baselines."}

Lately, embedding techniques that produce low-dimensional representations of ad IDs drastically improve CTR prediction accuracies. However, such learning techniques are data demanding and work poorly on new ads with little logging data, which is known as the cold-start problem. In this paper, we aim to improve CTR predictions during both the cold-start phase and the warm-up phase when a new ad is added to the candidate pool. We propose Meta-Embedding, a meta-learning-based approach that learns to generate desirable initial embeddings for new ad IDs. The proposed method trains an embedding generator for new ad IDs by making use of previously learned ads through gradient-based meta-learning. In other words, our method learns how to learn better embeddings. When a new ad comes, the trained generator initializes the embedding of its ID by feeding its contents and attributes. Next, the generated embedding can speed up the model fitting during the warm-up phase when a few labeled examples are available, compared to the existing initialization methods. Experimental results on three real-world datasets showed that Meta-Embedding can significantly improve both the cold-start and warm-up performances for six existing CTR prediction models, ranging from lightweight models such as Factorization Machines to complicated deep models such as PNN and DeepFM. All of the above apply to conversion rate (CVR) predictions as well."}

Nowadays, existing methods for network anomaly detection are usually based on traditional machine learning models, such as KNN, SVM, etc. Although these methods can obtain some outstanding features, they get a relatively low accuracy and rely heavily on manual design of traffic features, which has been obsolete in the age of big data. To solve the problems of low accuracy and feature engineering in intrusion detection, a traffic anomaly detection model BAT is proposed. The BAT model combines BLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-term memory) and attention mechanism. Attention mechanism is used to screen the network flow vector composed of packet vectors generated by the BLSTM model, which can obtain the key features for network traffic classification. In addition, we adopt multiple convolutional layers to capture the local features of traffic data. As multiple convolutional layers are used to process data samples, we refer BAT model as BAT-MC. The softmax classifier is used for network traffic classification. The proposed end-to-end model does not use any feature engineering skills and can automatically learn the key features of the hierarchy. It can well describe the network traffic behavior and improve the ability of anomaly detection effectively. We test our model on a public benchmark dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate our model has better performance than other comparison methods."}

Recent studies propose leveraging the rich contextual information in data provenance to detect threats in a host. Data provenance is a directed acyclic graph constructed from system audit data. Nodes in a provenance graph represent system entities (e.g., $processes$ and $files$ ) and edges represent system calls in the direction of information flow. However, previous studies, which extract features of the provenance graph, are not sensitive to the small quantity of threat-related entities and thus result in low performance when hunting stealthy threats. We present THREATRACE, an anomaly-based detector that detects host-based threats at system entity level without prior knowledge of attack patterns. We tailor GraphSAGE, an inductive graph neural network, to learn every benign entity’s role in a provenance graph. THREATRACE is a real-time system, which is scalable of monitoring a long-term running host and capable of detecting host-based intrusion in their early phase. We evaluate THREATRACE on five public datasets. The results show that THREATRACE outperforms seven state-of-the-art host intrusion detection systems."}

In this work, we address the degeneracy problem due to capturing spurious correlations by quantitatively analyzing the mutual information between language IDs of the source and decoded sentences. Inspired by this analysis, we propose to use two simple but effective approaches: (1) decoder pre-training; (2) back-translation.

Based on new ideas from the software testing community around coverage-guided mutational fuzz testing, we propose a new approach to the CDG problem which requires minimal setup and takes advantage of FPGA-accelerated simulation for rapid testing. We provide test input and coverage definitions that allow fuzz testing to be applied to RTL circuit verification. In addition we propose and implement a series of transformation passes that make it feasible to reset arbitrary RTL designs quickly, a requirement for deterministic test execution. Alongside this paper we provide rfuzz, a fully featured implementation of our testing methodology which we make available as open-source software to the research community. An empirical evaluation of RFUZZ shows promising results on archiving coverage for a wide range of different RTL designs ranging from communication IPs to an industry scale 64-bit CPU."}

As compared to the traditional artificial neural network applied to the IDS, the proposed technique adopts recent advances in deep learning studies such as initializing the parameters through the unsupervised pre-training of deep belief networks (DBN), therefore improving the detection accuracy.

MaTrack proposes a novel Dynamic-MUSIC method to detect the subtle reflection signals from human body and further differentiate them from those reflected signals from static objects (furniture, walls, etc.) to identify the human target's angle for localization.

A typical approach to realize it is natural language generation. However, previous works mostly adopt recurrent neural networks to meet the ends, leaving the potentially more effective pre-trained Transformer models under-explored. In fact, user and item IDs, as important identifiers in recommender systems, are inherently in different semantic space as words that pre-trained models were already trained on. Thus, how to effectively fuse IDs into such models becomes a critical issue. Inspired by recent advancement in prompt learning, we come up with two solutions: find alternative words to represent IDs (called discrete prompt learning) and directly input ID vectors to a pre-trained model (termed continuous prompt learning). In the latter case, ID vectors are randomly initialized but the model is trained in advance on large corpora, so they are actually in different learning stages. To bridge the gap, we further propose two training strategies: sequential tuning and recommendation as regularization. Extensive experiments show that our continuous prompt learning approach equipped with the training strategies consistently outperforms strong baselines on three datasets of explainable recommendation."}

By adjusting the proportion of training data and setting up multiple decision trees, we construct a MultiTree algorithm. In order to improve the overall detection effect, we choose several base classifiers, including decision tree, random forest, kNN, DNN, and design an ensemble adaptive voting algorithm. We use NSL-KDD Test+ to verify our approach, the accuracy of the MultiTree algorithm is 84.2%, while the final accuracy of the adaptive voting algorithm reaches 85.2%. Compared with other research papers, it is proved that our ensemble model effectively improves detection accuracy. In addition, through the analysis of data, it is found that the quality of data features is an important factor to determine the detection effect. In the future, we should optimize the feature selection and preprocessing of intrusion detection data to achieve better results."}

Existing methods rely on either explicit item IDs or general textual features for sequence modeling to understand user preferences. While promising, these approaches still struggle to model cold-start items or transfer knowledge to new datasets. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item features as language representations that can be generalized to new items and datasets. To this end, we present a novel framework, named Recformer, which effectively learns language representations for sequential recommendation. Specifically, we propose to formulate an item as a \"sentence\" (word sequence) by flattening item key-value attributes described by text so that an item sequence for a user becomes a sequence of sentences. For recommendation, Recformer is trained to understand the \"sentence\" sequence and retrieve the next \"sentence\". To encode item sequences, we design a bi-directional Transformer similar to the model Longformer but with different embedding layers for sequential recommendation. For effective representation learning, we propose novel pretraining and finetuning methods which combine language understanding and recommendation tasks. Therefore, Recformer can effectively recommend the next item based on language representations. Extensive experiments conducted on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Recformer for sequential recommendation, especially in low-resource and cold-start settings."}

It enables generative recommendation which directly generates the item(s) to recommend rather than calculating a ranking score for each and every candidate item as in traditional recommendation models, simplifying the recommendation pipeline from multi-stage filtering to single-stage filtering. To avoid generating excessively long text and hallucinated recommendations when deciding which item(s) to recommend, creating LLM-compatible item IDs to uniquely identify each item is essential for recommendation foundation models. In this study, we systematically examine the item ID creation and indexing problem for recommendation foundation models, using P5 as an example of the backbone LLM. To emphasize the importance of item indexing, we first discuss the issues of several trivial item indexing methods, such as random indexing, title indexing, and independent indexing. We then propose four simple yet effective solutions, including sequential indexing, collaborative indexing, semantic (content-based) indexing, and hybrid indexing. Our study highlights the significant influence of item indexing methods on the performance of LLM-based recommendation, and our results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions. The research also demonstrates how recent advances on language modeling and traditional IR principles such as indexing can help each other for better learning and inference.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like public key infrastructure (PKI)-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends."}

Regardless of successful applications of machine learning algorithms in many scenarios, e.g., facial recognition, malware detection, automatic driving, and intrusion detection, these algorithms and corresponding training data are vulnerable to a variety of security threats, inducing a significant performance decrease. Hence, it is vital to call for further attention regarding security threats and corresponding defensive techniques of machine learning, which motivates a comprehensive survey in this paper. Until now, researchers from academia and industry have found out many security threats against a variety of learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), principle component analysis, clustering, and prevailing deep neural networks. Thus, we revisit existing security threats and give a systematic survey on them from two aspects, the training phase and the testing/inferring phase. After that, we categorize current defensive techniques of machine learning into four groups: security assessment mechanisms, countermeasures in the training phase, those in the testing or inferring phase, data security, and privacy. Finally, we provide five notable trends in the research on security threats and defensive techniques of machine learning, which are worth doing in-depth studies in future."}

Despite much progress, we observe that existing directed fuzzers are still not efficient as they often symbolically or concretely execute a lot of program paths that cannot reach the target code. They thus waste a lot of computational resources. This paper presents BEACON, which can effectively direct a grey-box fuzzer in the sea of paths in a provable manner. That is, assisted by a lightweight static analysis that computes abstracted preconditions for reaching the target, we can prune 82.94% of the executing paths at runtime with negligible analysis overhead (<5h) but with the guarantee that the pruned paths must be spurious with respect to the target. We have implemented our approach, BEACON, and compared it to five state-of-the-art (directed) fuzzers in the application scenario of vulnerability reproduction. The evaluation results demonstrate that BEACON is 11.50x faster on average than existing directed grey-box fuzzers and it can also improve the speed of the conventional coverage-guided fuzzers, AFL, AFL++, and Mopt, to reproduce specific bugs with 6.31x, 11.86x, and 10.92x speedup, respectively. More interestingly, when used to test the vulnerability patches, BEACON found 14 incomplete fixes of existing CVE-identified vulnerabilities and 8 new bugs while 10 of them are exploitable with new CVE ids assigned."}

The extent to which a time hierarchy-type theorem holds in the classic distributed LOCAL model has been open for many years. In particular, it is consistent with previous results that all natural problems in the LOCAL model can be classified according to a small constant number of complexities, such as O(1), O(log* n), O(log n), 2^{O(sqrt{log n}), etc.In this paper we establish the first time hierarchy theorem for the LOCAL model and prove that several gaps exist in the LOCAL time hierarchy. Our main results are as follows:&#x2022; We define an infinite set of simple coloring problems called Hierarchical 2&#x00BD;-Coloring. A correctly colored graph can be confirmed by simply checking the neighborhood of each vertex, so this problem fits into the class of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems. However, the complexity of the k-level Hierarchical 2&#x00BD;-Coloring problem is &#x0398;(n^{1/k}), for positive integer k. The upper and lower bounds hold for both general graphs and trees, and for both randomized and deterministic algorithms.&#x2022; Consider any LCL problem on bounded degree trees. We prove an automatic-speedup theorem that states that any randomized n^{o(1)}-time algorithm solving the LCL can be transformed into a deterministic O(log n)-time algorithm. Together with a previous result, this establishes that on trees, there are no natural deterministic complexities in the ranges &#x03C9;(log* n)&#x2014;o(log n) or &#x03C9;(log n)&#x2014;n^{o(1)}.&#x2022; We expose a gap in the randomized time hierarchy on general graphs. Roughly speaking, any randomized algorithm that solves an LCL problem in sublogarithmic time can be sped up to run in O(T_{LLL}) time, which is the complexity of the distributed Lovasz local lemma problem, currently known to be &#x03A9;(log log n) and 2^{O(sqrt{log log n})} on bounded degree graphs.Finally, we revisit Naor and Stockmeyers characterization of O(1)-time LOCAL algorithms for LCL problems (as order-invariant w.r.t. vertex IDs) and calculate the complexity gaps that are directly implied by their proof. For n-rings we see a &#x03C9;(1)&#x2014;o(log* n) complexity gap, for (sqrt{n} &#x00D7; &#x221A;{n})-tori an &#x03C9;(1)&#x2014;o(sqrt{log* n}) gap, and for bounded degree trees and general graphs, an &#x03C9;(1)&#x2014;o(log(log* n)) complexity gap."}

Specifically, the Random Forest algorithm has the highest accuracy of 99.86% using the relevant selected features of 22, whereas the J48 classifier algorithm provides an accuracy of 99.87% using 52 relevant selected features with longer execution time."}

Such applications have created various security threats, especially in unattended environments. To ensure the security and dependability of WSN services, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) should be in place. This IDS has to be compatible with the characteristics of WSNs and capable of detecting the largest possible number of security threats. In this paper a specialized dataset for WSN is developed to help better detect and classify four types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: Blackhole, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling attacks. This paper considers the use of LEACH protocol which is one of the most popular hierarchical routing protocols in WSNs. A scheme has been defined to collect data from Network Simulator 2 (NS-2) and then processed to produce 23 features. The collected dataset is called WSN-DS. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been trained on the dataset to detect and classify different DoS attacks. The results show that WSN-DS improved the ability of IDS to achieve higher classification accuracy rate. WEKA toolbox was used with holdout and 10-Fold Cross Validation methods. The best results were achieved with 10-Fold Cross Validation with one hidden layer. The classification accuracies of attacks were 92.8%, 99.4%, 92.2%, 75.6%, and 99.8% for Blackhole, Flooding, Scheduling, and Grayhole attacks, in addition to the normal case (without attacks), respectively."}

In order to find both, known and unknown intrusion scenarios, we consider a novel unsupervised learning approach which we call CANet. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning based intrusion detection system (IDS) that naturally handles the data structure of the high dimensional CAN bus, where different message types are sent at different times. Our method is evaluated on real and synthetic CAN data. A comparison with previous machine learning based methods shows that CANet outperforms them by a significant margin.

This makes person Re-Identification (ReID) among multiple cameras a very challenging task. This work is motivated to learn mid-level human attributes which are robust to such visual appearance variations. And we propose a semi-supervised attribute learning framework which progressively boosts the accuracy of attributes only using a limited number of labeled data. Specifically, this framework involves a three-stage training. A deep Convolutional Neural Network (dCNN) is first trained on an independent dataset labeled with attributes. Then it is fine-tuned on another dataset only labeled with person IDs using our defined triplet loss. Finally, the updated dCNN predicts attribute labels for the target dataset, which is combined with the independent dataset for the final round of fine-tuning. The predicted attributes, namely \\emph{deep attributes} exhibit superior generalization ability across different datasets. By directly using the deep attributes with simple Cosine distance, we have obtained surprisingly good accuracy on four person ReID datasets. Experiments also show that a simple metric learning modular further boosts our method, making it significantly outperform many recent works."}

Conventional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are incapable of detecting these intrusive events as their outcomes reflect high false positive rates (FPRs). In this paper, we present a novel Geometric Area Analysis (GAA) technique based on Trapezoidal Area Estimation (TAE) for each observation computed from the parameters of the Beta Mixture Model (BMM) for features and the distances between observations. As this GAA-based detection depends on the methodology of anomaly-based detection (ADS), it constructs the areas of normal observations in a normal profile with those of the testing set estimated from the same parameters to recognise abnormal patterns. We also design a scalable framework for handling large-scale networks, and our GAA technique considers a decision engine module in this framework. The performance of our GAA technique is evaluated using the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets. To reduce the high-dimensional data of network connections, we apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and evaluate its influence on the GAA technique. The empirical results show that our technique achieves a higher detection rate and lower FPR with a lower processing time than other competing methods."}

Fog computing acting as a mediator provides local processing of the end-users’ requests and reduced delays in communication between the end-users and the cloud via fog devices. Therefore, the authenticity of incoming network traffic on the fog devices is of immense importance. These devices are vulnerable to malicious attacks. All kinds of information, especially financial and health information travel through these devices. Attackers target these devices by sending malicious data packets. It is imperative to detect these intrusions to provide secure and reliable service to the user. So, an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for the secure functioning of fog without compromising efficiency. In this paper, we propose a method (Auto-IF) for intrusion detection based on deep learning approach using Autoencoder (AE) and Isolation Forest (IF) for the fog environment. This approach targets only binary classification of the incoming packets as fog devices are more concerned about differentiating attack from normal packets in real-time. We validate the proposed method on the benchmark NSL-KDD dataset. Our technique of intrusion detection achieves a high accuracy rate of 95.4% as compared to many other state-of-art intrusion detection methods."}

Likewise, a malicious application could simulate the behavior of the advertising library, forging the user's interaction and stealing money from the advertiser. This paper describes AdSplit, where we extended Android to allow an application and its advertising to run as separate processes, under separate user-ids, eliminating the need for applications to request permissions on behalf of their advertising libraries, and providing services to validate the legitimacy of clicks, locally and remotely. AdSplit automatically recompiles apps to extract their ad services, and we measure minimal runtime overhead. AdSplit also supports a system resource that allows advertisements to display their content in an embedded HTML widget, without requiring any native code."}

The success of NIDS is highly dependent on the performance of the algorithms and improvement methods used to increase the classification accuracy and decrease the training and testing times of the algorithms. We propose an effective deep learning approach, self-taught learning (STL)-IDS, based on the STL framework. The proposed approach is used for feature learning and dimensionality reduction. It reduces training and testing time considerably and effectively improves the prediction accuracy of support vector machines (SVM) with regard to attacks. The proposed model is built using the sparse autoencoder mechanism, which is an effective learning algorithm for reconstructing a new feature representation in an unsupervised manner. After the pre-training stage, the new features are fed into the SVM algorithm to improve its detection capability for intrusion and classification accuracy. Moreover, the efficiency of the approach in binary and multiclass classification is studied and compared with that of shallow classification methods, such as J48, naive Bayesian, random forest, and SVM. Results show that our approach has accelerated SVM training and testing times and performed better than most of the previous approaches in terms of performance metrics in binary and multiclass classification. The proposed STL-IDS approach improves network intrusion detection and provides a new research method for intrusion detection."}

However, indoor environments were full of complex objects, the signals might be reflected by the obstacles. Compared with the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) signal, the signal transmitting path delay contained in None-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signal would induce positive distance errors and position errors. Before employing ranging information from the channels to calculate the position, LOS/NLOS classification or identification was necessary for selecting the “clean” channels. In conventional method, features extracted from the UWB channel impulse response (CIR) or some other signal properties were employed as the input vector of the machine learning methods, e.g. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-layer Perception (MLP). Deep learning methods represented by Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) had performed superior performance in dealing with time series data classification. In this pap er, deep learning method CNN-LSTM was employed in the UWB NLOS/LOS signal classification. UWB CIR data was directly input to the CNN-LSTM. CNN was employed for exploring and extracting the features automatically, and then, the CNN outputs were fed into the LSTM for classification. Open source datasets collected from seven different sites were employed in the experiments. Classification accuracy of CNN-LSTM with different settings was compared for analyzing the performance. The results showed that CNN-LSTM obtained stat e-of-art classification performance."}

Typically, the observation noise is assumed to be independent of the evaluation point and satisfies a tail bound taken uniformly on the domain. In this work, we consider the setting of heteroscedastic noise, that is, we explicitly allow the noise distribution to depend on the evaluation point. We show that this leads to new trade-offs for information and regret, which are not taken into account by existing approaches like upper confidence bound algorithms (UCB) or Thompson Sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a frequentist regret framework, that is similar to the Bayesian analysis of Russo and Van Roy (2014). We prove a new high-probability regret bound for general, possibly randomized policies, depending on a quantity we call the regret-information ratio. From this bound, we define a frequentist version of Information Directed Sampling (IDS) to minimize a surrogate of the regret-information ratio over all possible action sampling distributions. In order to construct the surrogate function, we generalize known concentration inequalities for least squares regression in separable Hilbert spaces to the case of heteroscedastic noise. This allows us to formulate several variants of IDS for linear and reproducing kernel Hilbert space response functions, yielding a family of novel algorithms for Bayesian optimization. We also provide frequentist regret bounds, which in the homoscedastic case are comparable to existing bounds for UCB, but can be much better when the noise is heteroscedastic. Finally, we empirically demonstrate in a linear setting, that some of our methods can outperform UCB and Thompson Sampling, even when the noise is homoscedastic."}

It is an essential primitive for a broad range of applications including intrusion detection for safety precautions, patient monitoring in hospitals, child and elder care at home, etc. Despite of the prevalent signal feature Received Signal Strength (RSS), most robust and reliable solutions resort to finer-grained channel descriptor at physical layer, e.g., the Channel State Information (CSI) in the 802.11n standard. Among a large body of emerging techniques, however, few of them have explored full potentials of CSI for human detection. Moreover, space diversity supported by nowadays popular multi-antenna systems are not investigated to the comparable extent as frequency diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for device-free PAssive Detection of moving humans with dynamic Speed (PADS). Both amplitude and phase information of CSI are extracted and shaped into sensitive metrics for target detection; and CSI across multi-antennas in MIMO systems are further exploited to improve the detection accuracy and robustness. We prototype PADS on commercial WiFi devices and experiment results in different scenarios demonstrate that PADS achieves great performance improvement in spite of dynamic human movements."}

However, providing high-security features that guarantee the correctness and confidentiality of patients’ data is a significant challenge. Any alteration to the data could affect the patients’ treatment, leading to human casualties in emergency conditions. Due to the high dimensionality and prominent dynamicity of the data involved in such systems, machine learning has the promise to provide an effective solution when it comes to intrusion detection. However, most of the available healthcare intrusion detection systems either use network flow metrics or patients’ biometric data to build their datasets. This paper aims to show that combining both network and biometric metrics as features performs better than using only one of the two types of features. We have built a real-time Enhanced Healthcare Monitoring System (EHMS) testbed that monitors the patients’ biometrics and collects network flow metrics. The monitored data is sent to a remote server for further diagnostic and treatment decisions. Man-in-the-middle cyber-attacks have been used, and a dataset of more than 16 thousand records of normal and attack healthcare data has been created. The system then applies different machine learning methods for training and testing the dataset against these attacks. Results prove that the performance has improved by 7% to 25% in some cases, and this shows the robustness of the proposed system in providing proper intrusion detection."}

Attack classification and mapping of the attack features is provided corresponding to each attack. Issues which are related to detecting low-frequency attacks using network attack dataset are also discussed and viable methods are suggested for improvement. Machine learning techniques have been analyzed and compared in terms of their detection capability for detecting the various category of attacks.

However, the predictive performance of purely unsupervised anomaly detection often fails to match the required detection rates in many tasks and there exists a need for labeled data to guide the model generation. Our first contribution shows that classical semi-supervised approaches, originating from a supervised classifier, are inappropriate and hardly detect new and unknown anomalies. We argue that semi-supervised anomaly detection needs to ground on the unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this requirement. Although being intrinsically non-convex, we further show that the optimization problem has a convex equivalent under relatively mild assumptions. Additionally, we propose an active learning strategy to automatically filter candidates for labeling. In an empirical study on network intrusion detection data, we observe that the proposed learning methodology requires much less labeled data than the state-of-the-art, while achieving higher detection accuracies."}

Although such devices simplify and automate every day tasks, they also introduce tremendous security flaws. Current insufficient security measures employed to defend smart devices make IoT the “weakest” link to breaking into a secure infrastructure, and therefore an attractive target to attackers. This paper proposes a three layer intrusion detection system (IDS) that uses a supervised approach to detect a range of popular network based cyber-attacks on IoT networks. The system consists of three main functions: 1) classify the type and profile the normal behavior of each IoT device connected to the network; 2) identifies malicious packets on the network when an attack is occurring; and 3) classifies the type of the attack that has been deployed. The system is evaluated within a smart home testbed consisting of eight popular commercially available devices. The effectiveness of the proposed IDS architecture is evaluated by deploying 12 attacks from 4 main network based attack categories, such as denial of service (DoS), man-in-the-middle (MITM)/spoofing, reconnaissance, and replay. Additionally, the system is also evaluated against four scenarios of multistage attacks with complex chains of events. The performance of the system’s three core functions result in an ${F}$ -measure of: 1) 96.2%; 2) 90.0%; and 3) 98.0%. This demonstrates that the proposed architecture can automatically distinguish between IoT devices on the network, whether network activity is malicious or benign, and detect which attack was deployed on which device connected to the network successfully."}

Routing in many of IoT networks has been performed using the routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL), due to its energy-efficient mechanisms, secure modes availability, and its adaptivity to work in various environments; hence, RPL security has been the focus of many researchers. This paper presents a comprehensive study of RPL, its known attacks, and the mitigation methods proposed to counter these attacks. We conducted a detailed review of the RPL standard, including a recently proposed modification. Also, we investigated all recently published attacks on RPL and their mitigation methods through the literature. Based on this investigation, and to the best of our knowledge, we introduced a first-of-its-kind classification scheme for the mitigation methods that is based on the techniques used for the mitigation. Furthermore, we thoroughly discussed RPL-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and their classifications, highlighting the most recently proposed IDSs."}

We construct a covert channel between different computing systems that utilizes audio modulation/demodulation to exchange data between the computing systems over the air medium. The underlying network stack is based on a communication system that was originally designed for robust underwater communication. We adapt the communication system to implement covert and stealthy communications by utilizing the ultrasonic frequency range. We further demonstrate how the scenario of covert acoustical communication over the air medium can be extended to multi-hop communications and even to wireless mesh networks. A covert acoustical mesh network can be conceived as a meshed botnet or malnet that is accessible via inaudible audio transmissions. Different applications of covert acoustical mesh networks are presented, including the use for remote keylogging over multiple hops. It is shown that the concept of a covert acoustical mesh network renders many conventional security concepts useless, as acoustical communications are usually not considered. Finally, countermeasures against covert acoustical mesh networks are discussed, including the use of lowpass filtering in computing systems and a host-based intrusion detection system for analyzing audio input and output in order to detect any irregularities."}

Today, SDN is widely implemented in many data center’s network environments. Nevertheless, emerging technology itself can lead to many vulnerabilities and threats which are still challenging for manufacturers to address it. Therefore, deploying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to monitor malicious activities is a crucial part of the network architecture. Although the centralized view of the SDN network creates new opportunities for the implementation of IDSs, the performance of these detection techniques relies on the quality of the training datasets. Unfortunately, there are no publicly available datasets that can be used directly for anomaly detection systems applied in SDN networks. The majority of the published studies use non-compatible and outdated datasets, such as the KDD’99 dataset. This manuscript aims to generate an attack-specific SDN dataset and it is publicly available to the researchers. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the first solutions to produce a comprehensive SDN dataset to verify the performance of intrusion detection systems. The new dataset includes the benign and various attack categories that can occur in the different elements of the SDN platform. Further, we demonstrate the use of our proposed dataset by performing an experimental evaluation using eight popular machine-learning-based techniques for IDSs."}

Network data features has a great impact on the performances of ML-based NIDSs. However, evaluating ML models often are not reliable, as each ML-enabled NIDS is trained and validated using different data features that may do not contain security events. Therefore, a common ground feature set from multiple datasets is required to evaluate an ML model's detection accuracy and its ability to generalise across datasets. This paper presents NetFlow features from four benchmark NIDS datasets known as UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, ToN-IoT, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 using their publicly available packet capture files. In a real-world scenario, NetFlow features are relatively easier to extract from network traffic compared to the complex features used in the original datasets, as they are usually extracted from packet headers. The generated Netflow datasets have been labelled for solving binary- and multiclass-based learning challenges. Preliminary results indicate that NetFlow features lead to similar binary-class results and lower multi-class classification results amongst the four datasets compared to their respective original features datasets.

It incorporates a novel reliable peer-to-peer energy system that is based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm and it achieves high throughput. In order to prevent smart grid attacks, the proposed framework makes the generation of blocks using short signatures and hash functions. The proposed deep learning-based scheme is an intrusion detection system (IDS), which employs recurrent neural networks for detecting network attacks and fraudulent transactions in the blockchain-based energy network.

Recent studies have explored a variety of techniques to analyze provenance graphs for automated host intrusion detection, focusing particularly on advanced persistent threats. Sifting through their design documents, we identify four common dimensions that drive the development of provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes): scope (can PIDSes detect modern attacks that infiltrate across application boundaries?), attack agnosticity (can PIDSes detect novel attacks without a priori knowledge of attack characteristics?), timeliness (can PIDSes efficiently monitor host systems as they run?), and attack reconstruction (can PIDSes distill attack activity from large provenance graphs so that sysadmins can easily understand and quickly respond to system intrusion?). We present Kairos, the first PIDS that simultaneously satisfies the desiderata in all four dimensions, whereas existing approaches sacrifice at least one and struggle to achieve comparable detection performance.Kairos leverages a novel graph neural network based encoder-decoder architecture that learns the temporal evolution of a provenance graph’s structural changes to quantify the degree of anomalousness for each system event. Then, based on this fine-grained information, Kairos reconstructs attack footprints, generating compact summary graphs that accurately describe malicious activity over a stream of system audit logs. Using state-of-the-art benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Kairos outperforms previous approaches."}

In contrast to previous semantic mapping systems, PanopticFusion is able to densely predict class labels of a background region (stuff) and individually segment arbitrary foreground objects (things). In addition, our system has the capability to reconstruct a large-scale scene and extract a labeled mesh thanks to its use of a spatially hashed volumetric map representation. Our system first predicts pixel-wise panoptic labels (class labels for stuff regions and instance IDs for thing regions) for incoming RGB frames by fusing 2D semantic and instance segmentation outputs. The predicted panoptic labels are integrated into the volumetric map together with depth measurements while keeping the consistency of the instance IDs, which could vary frame to frame, by referring to the 3D map at that moment. In addition, we construct a fully connected conditional random field (CRF) model with respect to panoptic labels for map regularization. For online CRF inference, we propose a novel unary potential approximation and a map division strategy. We evaluated the performance of our system on the ScanNet (v2) dataset. PanopticFusion outperformed or compared with state-of-the-art offline 3D DNN methods in both semantic and instance segmentation benchmarks. Also, we demonstrate a promising augmented reality application using a 3D panoptic map generated by the proposed system."}

Meanwhile, the pre-trained modality encoders, such as BERT [9] and Vision Transformer [11], have become increasingly powerful in modeling the raw modality features of an item, such as text and images. Given this, a natural question arises: can a purely modality-based recommendation model (MoRec) outperforms or matches a pure ID-based model (IDRec) by replacing the itemID embedding with a SOTA modality encoder? In fact, this question was answered ten years ago when IDRec beats MoRec by a strong margin in both recommendation accuracy and efficiency. We aim to revisit this 'old' question and systematically study MoRec from several aspects. Specifically, we study several sub-questions: (i) which recommendation paradigm, MoRec or IDRec, performs better in practical scenarios, especially in the general setting and warm item scenarios where IDRec has a strong advantage? does this hold for items with different modality features? (ii) can the latest technical advances from other communities (i.e., natural language processing and computer vision) translate into accuracy improvement for MoRec? (iii) how to effectively utilize item modality representation, can we use it directly or do we have to adjust it with new data? (iv) are there any key challenges that MoRec needs to address in practical applications? To answer them, we conduct rigorous experiments for item recommendations with two popular modalities, i.e., text and vision. We provide the first empirical evidence that MoRec is already comparable to its IDRec counterpart with an expensive end-to-end training method, even for warm item recommendation. Our results potentially imply that the dominance of IDRec in the RS field may be greatly challenged in the future.

At the core of defect data preparation is the identification of post-release defects. Prior studies leverage many heuristics (e.g., keywords and issue IDs) to identify post-release defects. However, such the heuristic approach is based on several assumptions, which pose common threats to the validity of many studies. In this paper, we set out to investigate the nature of the difference of defect datasets generated by the heuristic approach and the realistic approach that leverages the earliest affected release that is realistically estimated by a software development team for a given defect. In addition, we investigate the impact of defect identification approaches on the predictive accuracy and the ranking of defective modules that are produced by defect models. Through a case study of defect datasets of 32 releases, we find that that the heuristic approach has a large impact on both defect count datasets and binary defect datasets. Surprisingly, we find that the heuristic approach has a minimal impact on defect count models, suggesting that future work should not be too concerned about defect count models that are constructed using heuristic defect datasets. On the other hand, using defect datasets generated by the realistic approach lead to an improvement in the predictive accuracy of defect classification models."}

Therefore, there is a need for few-shot detection. In this paper, a detection method based on a meta-learning framework is proposed for this purpose. The proposed method can be used to distinguish and compare a pair of network traffic samples as a basic task of learning, including a normal unaffected sample and a malicious one. To accomplish this task, we design a deep neural network (DNN) named FC-Net, which mainly comprises two parts: feature extraction network and comparison network. FC-Net learns a pair of feature maps for classification from a pair of network traffic samples, then compares the obtained feature maps, and finally determines whether the pair of samples belongs to the same type. To evaluate the proposed detection method, we construct two datasets for few-shot network intrusion detection based on real network traffic data sources, using a specifically developed approach. The experimental results indicate that the proposed detection method is universal and is not limited to specific datasets or attack types. Training and testing on the same datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the average detection rate up to 98.88%. The outcome of training on one dataset and testing on the other one confirms that the proposed method can achieve better performance. In a few-shot scenario, malicious samples in an untrained dataset can be detected successfully, and the average detection rate is up to 99.62%."}

However, since the deployment of thousands of IoT based devices is in an open field, there are many new threats in Agriculture 4.0. Security researchers are involved in this topic to ensure the safety of the system since an adversary can initiate many cyber attacks, such as DDoS attacks to making a service unavailable and then injecting false data to tell us that the agricultural equipment is safe but in reality, it has been theft. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection system for DDoS attacks based on three models, namely, convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.

In this work, we propose an ensemble-based multi-filter feature selection method that combines the output of four filter methods to achieve an optimum selection.

In this paper, we investigate the prospects of using machine learning classification algorithms for securing IoT against DoS attacks. A comprehensive study is carried on the classifiers which can advance the development of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Performance assessment of classifiers is done in terms of prominent metrics and validation methods. Popular datasets CIDDS-001, UNSW-NB15, and NSL-KDD are used for benchmarking classifiers. Friedman and Nemenyi tests are employed to analyze the significant differences among classifiers statistically. In addition, Raspberry Pi is used to evaluate the response time of classifiers on IoT specific hardware. We also discuss a methodology for selecting the best classifier as per application requirements. The main goals of this study are to motivate IoT security researchers for developing IDSs using ensemble learning, and suggesting appropriate methods for statistical assessment of classifier’s performance."}

Furthermore, since ICSs are often employed in critical infrastructures (e.g., nuclear plants) and manufacturing companies (e.g., chemical industries), attacks can lead to devastating physical damages. In dealing with this security requirement, the research community focuses on developing new security mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), facilitated by leveraging modern machine learning techniques. However, these algorithms require a testing platform and a considerable amount of data to be trained and tested accurately. To satisfy this prerequisite, Academia, Industry, and Government are increasingly proposing testbed (i.e., scaled-down versions of ICSs or simulations) to test the performances of the IDSs. Furthermore, to enable researchers to cross-validate security systems (e.g., security-by-design concepts or anomaly detectors), several datasets have been collected from testbeds and shared with the community. In this paper, we provide a deep and comprehensive overview of ICSs, presenting the architecture design, the employed devices, and the security protocols implemented. We then collect, compare, and describe testbeds and datasets in the literature, highlighting key challenges and design guidelines to keep in mind in the design phases. Furthermore, we enrich our work by reporting the best performing IDS algorithms tested on every dataset to create a baseline in state of the art for this field. Finally, driven by knowledge accumulated during this survey’s development, we report advice and good practices on the development, the choice, and the utilization of testbeds, datasets, and IDSs."}

Despite its central importance, the CAN bus system does not support authentication and authorization mechanisms, i.e., CAN messages are broadcast without basic security features. As a result, it is easy for attackers to launch attacks at the CAN bus network system. Attackers can compromise the CAN bus system in several ways including Denial of Service (DoS), Fuzzing and Spoofing attacks. It is imperative to devise methodologies to protect modern cars against the aforementioned attacks. In this paper, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect and mitigate the CAN bus network attacks. We generate our own dataset by first extracting attack-free data from our experimental car and by injecting attacks into the latter and collecting the dataset. We use the dataset for testing and training our model. With our selected hyper-parameter values, our results demonstrate that our classifier is efficient in detecting the CAN bus network attacks, we achieved an overall detection accuracy of 99.995%. We also compare the proposed LSTM method with the Survival Analysis for automobile IDS dataset which is developed by the Hacking and Countermeasure Research Lab, Korea. Our proposed LSTM model achieves a higher detection rate than the Survival Analysis method."}

In this paper, we aim to systematically and scientifically study this bias from both data and algorithm aspects. First, using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system and Individual Typology Angle, we contribute a benchmark called Identity Shades (IDS) database, which effectively quantifies the degree of the bias with respect to skin tone in existing face recognition algorithms and commercial APIs. Further, we provide two skin-tone aware training datasets, called BUPT-Globalface dataset and BUPT-Balancedface dataset, to remove bias in training data. Finally, to mitigate the algorithmic bias, we propose a novel meta-learning algorithm, called Meta Balanced Network (MBN), which learns adaptive margins in large margin loss such that the model optimized by this loss can perform fairly across people with different skin tones. To determine the margins, our method optimizes a meta skewness loss on a clean and unbiased meta set and utilizes backward-on-backward automatic differentiation to perform a second order gradient descent step on the current margins. Extensive experiments show that MBN successfully mitigates bias and learns more balanced performance for people with different skin tones in face recognition.

It includes data sources and the transformations that have been applied to them. Data provenance has many uses, from forensics and security to aiding the reproducibility of scientific experiments. We present CamFlow, a whole-system provenance capture mechanism that integrates easily into a PaaS offering. While there have been several prior whole-system provenance systems that captured a comprehensive, systemic and ubiquitous record of a system's behavior, none have been widely adopted. They either A) impose too much overhead, B) are designed for long-outdated kernel releases and are hard to port to current systems, C) generate too much data, or D) are designed for a single system. CamFlow addresses these shortcoming by: 1) leveraging the latest kernel design advances to achieve efficiency; 2) using a self-contained, easily maintainable implementation relying on a Linux Security Module, NetFilter, and other existing kernel facilities; 3) providing a mechanism to tailor the captured provenance data to the needs of the application; and 4) making it easy to integrate provenance across distributed systems. The provenance we capture is streamed and consumed by tenant-built auditor applications. We illustrate the usability of our implementation by describing three such applications: demonstrating compliance with data regulations; performing fault/intrusion detection; and implementing data loss prevention. We also show how CamFlow can be leveraged to capture meaningful provenance without modifying existing applications."}

This technology can be efficient in carrying out small-area inspections of anomalous reflectance characteristics of trees at a very high level of detail. Increased frequency and intensity of insect induced forest disturbance has established a new demand for effective methods suitable in mapping and monitoring tasks. In this investigation, a novel miniaturized hyperspectral frame imaging sensor operating in the wavelength range of 500–900 nm was used to identify mature Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) trees suffering from infestation, representing a different outbreak phase, by the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). We developed a new processing method for analyzing spectral characteristic for high spatial resolution photogrammetric and hyperspectral images in forested environments, as well as for identifying individual anomalous trees. The dense point clouds, measured using image matching, enabled detection of single trees with an accuracy of 74.7%. We classified the trees into classes of healthy, infested and dead, and the results were promising. The best results for the overall accuracy were 76% (Cohen’s kappa 0.60), when using three color classes (healthy, infested, dead). For two color classes (healthy, dead), the best overall accuracy was 90% (kappa 0.80). The survey methodology based on high-resolution hyperspectral imaging will be of a high practical value for forest health management, indicating a status of bark beetle outbreak in time."}

Accordingly, it is conceivable to design proper Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS), for instance, for the traceability of resources, assets, and people. First of all, Radio Frequency (RF) radiogoniometry techniques, helpful in calculating AoA and AoD angles, are introduced in this paper. Subsequently, the topic relating to signal direction estimation is deepened. The Bluetooth Core Specification updates concerning version 5.1, both at the packet architecture and prototyping levels, are also reported. Some suitable platforms and development kits for running the new features are then presented, and some basic applications are illustrated.

We present a novel method for designing neural network topologies that directly map to a highly efficient FPGA implementation. By exploiting the equivalence of artificial neurons with quantized inputs/outputs and truth tables, we can train quantized neural networks that can be directly converted to a netlist of truth tables, and subsequently deployed as a highly pipelinable, massively parallel FPGA circuit. However, the neural network topology requires careful consideration since the hardware cost of truth tables grows exponentially with neuron fan-in. To obtain smaller networks where the whole netlist can be placed-and-routed onto a single FPGA, we derive a fan-in driven hardware cost model to guide topology design, and combine high sparsity with few-bit activation quantization to limit the neuron fan-in. We evaluate our approach on two tasks with very high intrinsic throughput requirements in high-energy physics and network intrusion detection. We show that the combination of sparsity and few-bit activation quantization results in high-speed circuits with small logic depth and low LUT cost, demonstrating competitive accuracy with less than 15 ns of inference latency and throughput in the hundreds of millions of inferences per second."}

So Intrusion Detection Systems have become a needful component in terms of computer and network security. There are various approaches being utilized in intrusion detections, but unfortunately any of the systems so far is not completely flawless. So, the quest of betterment continues. In this progression, here we present an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), by applying genetic algorithm (GA) to efficiently detect various types of network intrusions. Parameters and evolution processes for GA are discussed in details and implemented. This approach uses evolution theory to information evolution in order to filter the traffic data and thus reduce the complexity. To implement and measure the performance of our system we used the KDD99 benchmark dataset and obtained reasonable detection rate."}

To substantiate this, we trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks with the training data provided by the DARPA / KDD Cup ’99 challenge. To identify suitable LSTM-RNN network parameters and structure we experimented with various network topologies. We found networks with four memory blocks containing two cells each oer a good compromise between computational cost and detection performance. We applied forget gates and shortcut connections respectively. A learning rate of 0.1 and up to 1,000 epochs showed good results. We tested the performance on all features and on extracted minimal feature sets respectively. We evaluated dierent feature sets for the detection of all attacks within one network and also to train networks specialised on individual attack classes. Our results show that the LSTM classier provides superior performance in comparison to results previously published results of strong static classiers. With 93.82% accuracy and 22.13 cost, LSTM outperforms the winning entries of the KDD Cup ’99 challenge by far. This is due to the fact that LSTM learns to look back in time and correlate consecutive connection records. For the rst time ever, we have demonstrated the usefulness of LSTM networks to intrusion detection."}

The key idea is to pose 3D shape reconstruction as a 2D prediction problem. To that end, we first develop a simple baseline network that predicts entire voxel tubes at each pixel of a reference view. By leveraging well-proven architectures for 2D pixel-prediction tasks, we attain state-of-the-art results, clearly outperforming purely voxel-based approaches. We scale this baseline to higher resolutions by proposing a memory-efficient shape encoding, which recursively decomposes a 3D shape into nested shape layers, similar to the pieces of a Matryoshka doll. This allows reconstructing highly detailed shapes with complex topology, as demonstrated in extensive experiments; we clearly outperform previous octree-based approaches despite having a much simpler architecture using standard network components. Our Matryoshka networks further enable reconstructing shapes from IDs or shape similarity, as well as shape sampling."}

In this paper, we propose a novel network intrusion detection model utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We use CNN to select traffic features from raw data set automatically, and we set the cost function weight coefficient of each class based on its numbers to solve the imbalanced data set problem. The model not only reduces the false alarm rate (FAR) but also improves the accuracy of the class with small numbers. To reduce the calculation cost further, we convert the raw traffic vector format into image format. We use the standard NSL-KDD data set to evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN model. The experimental results show that the accuracy, FAR, and calculation cost of the proposed model perform better than traditional standard algorithms. It is an effective and reliable solution for the intrusion detection of a massive network."}

This paper tackles this challenge through jointly enforcing visual and temporal consistency in the combination of a local one-hot classification and a global multi-class classification. The local one-hot classification assigns images in a training batch with different person IDs, then adopts a Self-Adaptive Classification (SAC) model to classify them. The global multi-class classification is achieved by predicting labels on the entire unlabeled training set with the Memory-based Temporal-guided Cluster (MTC). MTC predicts multi-class labels by considering both visual similarity and temporal consistency to ensure the quality of label prediction. The two classification models are combined in a unified framework, which effectively leverages the unlabeled data for discriminative feature learning. Experimental results on three large-scale ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of proposed method in both unsupervised and unsupervised domain adaptive ReID tasks. For example, under unsupervised setting, our method outperforms recent unsupervised domain adaptive methods, which leverage more labels for training."}

As a primary defense of network infrastructure, an intrusion detection system is expected to adapt to dynamically changing threat landscape. Many supervised and unsupervised techniques have been devised by researchers from the discipline of machine learning and data mining to achieve reliable detection of anomalies. Deep learning is an area of machine learning which applies neuron-like structure for learning tasks. Deep learning has profoundly changed the way we approach learning tasks by delivering monumental progress in different disciplines like speech processing, computer vision, and natural language processing to name a few. It is only relevant that this new technology must be investigated for information security applications. The aim of this paper is to investigate the suitability of deep learning approaches for anomaly-based intrusion detection system. For this research, we developed anomaly detection models based on different deep neural network structures, including convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, and recurrent neural networks. These deep models were trained on NSLKDD training data set and evaluated on both test data sets provided by NSLKDD, namely NSLKDDTest+ and NSLKDDTest21. All experiments in this paper are performed by authors on a GPU-based test bed. Conventional machine learning-based intrusion detection models were implemented using well-known classification techniques, including extreme learning machine, nearest neighbor, decision-tree, random-forest, support vector machine, naive-bays, and quadratic discriminant analysis. Both deep and conventional machine learning models were evaluated using well-known classification metrics, including receiver operating characteristics, area under curve, precision-recall curve, mean average precision and accuracy of classification. Experimental results of deep IDS models showed promising results for real-world application in anomaly detection systems."}

As permutations of instance IDs are also valid solutions, the task requires learning of high-dimensional one-to-many mapping. As a result, state-of-the-art approaches use customized architectures and task-specific loss functions. We formulate panoptic segmentation as a discrete data generation problem, without relying on inductive bias of the task. A diffusion model is proposed to model panoptic masks, with a simple architecture and generic loss function. By simply adding past predictions as a conditioning signal, our method is capable of modeling video (in a streaming setting) and thereby learns to track object instances automatically. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our simple approach can perform competitively to state-of-the-art specialist methods in similar settings. 1"}

The traditional intrusion detection technologies cannot be well adapted in the complex Internet environment of IoT. For the deep learning algorithm of intrusion detection, a neural network structure may have fine detection accuracy for one kind of attack, but it may not have a good detection effect when facing other attacks. Therefore, it is urgent to design a self-adaptive model to change the network structure for different attack types. This paper presents an intrusion detection model based on improved genetic algorithm (GA) and deep belief network (DBN). Facing different types of attacks, through multiple iterations of the GA, the optimal number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each layer are generated adaptively, so that the intrusion detection model based on the DBN achieves a high detection rate with a compact structure. Finally, the NSL-KDD dataset was used to simulate and evaluate the model and algorithms. The experimental results show that the improved intrusion detection model combined with DBN can effectively improve the recognition rate of intrusion attacks and reduce the complexity of the neural network structure."}

The idea is simple: a webpage delivers extra workload (JavaScript) that consumes computational resources on the client machine to solve cryptographic puzzles, typically without notifying users or having explicit user consent. This new mechanism, often heavily abused and thus considered a threat termed \"cryptojacking\", is estimated to affect over 10 million web users every month; however, only a few anecdotal reports exist so far and little is known about its severeness, infrastructure, and technical characteristics behind the scene. This is likely due to the lack of effective approaches to detect cryptojacking at a large-scale (e.g., VirusTotal). In this paper, we take a first step towards an in-depth study over cryptojacking. By leveraging a set of inherent characteristics of cryptojacking scripts, we build CMTracker, a behavior-based detector with two runtime profilers for automatically tracking Cryptocurrency Mining scripts and their related domains. Surprisingly, our approach successfully discovered 2,770 unique cryptojacking samples from 853,936 popular web pages, including 868 among top 100K in Alexa list. Leveraging these samples, we gain a more comprehensive picture of the cryptojacking attacks, including their impact, distribution mechanisms, obfuscation, and attempts to evade detection. For instance, a diverse set of organizations benefit from cryptojacking based on the unique wallet ids. In addition, to stay under the radar, they frequently update their attack domains (fastflux) on the order of days. Many attackers also apply evasion techniques, including limiting the CPU usage, obfuscating the code, etc."}

In these approaches, learning-based ensemble models can facilitate the identification of complex malicious events and concurrently ensure data privacy. Such models can also be used to provide additional security and privacy assurances during the live migration of virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud and to protect Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This would allow the secure transfer of VMs between data centers or cloud providers in real time. This article proposes a deep blockchain framework (DBF) designed to offer security-based distributed intrusion detection and privacy-based blockchain with smart contracts in IoT networks. The intrusion detection method is employed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep learning algorithm to deal with sequential network data and is assessed using the data sets of UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT. The privacy-based blockchain and smart contract methods are developed using the Ethereum library to provide privacy to the distributed intrusion detection engines. The DBF framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the experimental outcomes reveal that DBF outperforms the other competing models. The framework has the potential to be used as a decision support system that can assist users and cloud providers in securely migrating their data in a timely and reliable manner."}

To detect such threats, we propose a RPL-specification, obtained by a semi-auto profiling technique that constructs a high-level abstract of operations through network simulation traces, to use as reference for verifying the node behaviors. This specification, including all the legitimate protocol states and transitions with corresponding statistics, will be implemented as a set of rules in the intrusion detection agents, in the form of the cluster heads propagated to monitor the whole network. In order to save resources, we set the cluster members to report related information about itself and other neighbors to the cluster head instead of making the head overhearing all the communication. As a result, information about a cluster member will be reported by different neighbors, which allow the cluster head to do cross-check. We propose to record the sequence in RPL Information Object (DIO) and Information Solicitation (DIS) messages to eliminate the synchronized issue created by the delay in transmitting the report, in which the cluster head only does cross-check on information that come from sources with the same sequence. Simulation results show that the proposed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has a high accuracy rate in detecting RPL topology attacks, while only creating insignificant overhead (about 6.3%) that enable its scalability in large-scale network."}

Experiments on the well-known KDD 99 and NSL-KDD data sets show that the system has leading performance. The overall detection rate was 99.42% using KDD 99 and 99.31% using NSL-KDD with false positive rates as low as 0.05% and 0.84%, respectively. In particular, for detecting the denial of service attacks, the system achieved detection rates of 99.98% and 99.55%, respectively. Comparative experiments showed that the GRU is more suitable as a memory unit for IDS than LSTM, and proved that it is an effective simplification and improvement of LSTM. Moreover, the bidirectional GRU can reach the best performance compared with the recently published methods."}

New genomes assembled by the JGI for both species and are displayed in Gbrowse and are also available for searches using BLAST.

The proposed approach: (1) provides a natural generalization of collocation kernel methods to nonlinear PDEs and IPs; (2) has guaranteed convergence for a very general class of PDEs, and comes equipped with a path to compute error bounds for specific PDE approximations; (3) inherits the state-of-the-art computational complexity of linear solvers for dense kernel matrices. The main idea of our method is to approximate the solution of a given PDE as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of a Gaussian process conditioned on solving the PDE at a finite number of collocation points. Although this optimization problem is infinite-dimensional, it can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one by introducing additional variables corresponding to the values of the derivatives of the solution at collocation points; this generalizes the representer theorem arising in Gaussian process regression. The reduced optimization problem has the form of a quadratic objective function subject to nonlinear constraints; it is solved with a variant of the Gauss--Newton method. The resulting algorithm (a) can be interpreted as solving successive linearizations of the nonlinear PDE, and (b) in practice is found to converge in a small number of iterations (2 to 10), for a wide range of PDEs. Most traditional approaches to IPs interleave parameter updates with numerical solution of the PDE; our algorithm solves for both parameter and PDE solution simultaneously. Experiments on nonlinear elliptic PDEs, Burgers' equation, a regularized Eikonal equation, and an IP for permeability identification in Darcy flow illustrate the efficacy and scope of our framework."}

Modern host-based detection methods require the host to be infected first in order to identify anomalies and detect the malware. By the time of infection, it can be too late as some of the system’s assets would have been already exfiltrated or encrypted by the malware. Conversely, the network-based methods can be effective in detecting ransomware attacks, as most ransomware families try to connect to command and control servers before their harmful payloads are executed. Therefore, a careful analysis of ransomware network traffic can be one of the key means for early detection. This paper demonstrates a comprehensive behavioral analysis of crypto ransomware network activities, taking Locky, one of the most serious families, as a case study. A dedicated testbed was built, and a set of valuable and informative network features were extracted and classified into multiple types. A network-based intrusion detection system was implemented, employing two independent classifiers working in parallel on different levels: packet and flow levels. The experimental evaluation of the proposed detection system demonstrates that it offers high detection accuracy, low false positive rate, valid extracted features, and is highly effective in tracking ransomware network activities."}

The goal of this work is to show that the performance of those solvers can be greatly enhanced using reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we investigate a specific methodology for solving IPs, known as the Cutting Plane Method. This method is employed as a subroutine by all modern IP solvers. We present a deep RL formulation, network architecture, and algorithms for intelligent adaptive selection of cutting planes (aka cuts). Across a wide range of IP tasks, we show that the trained RL agent significantly outperforms human-designed heuristics, and effectively generalizes to 10X larger instances and across IP problem classes. The trained agent is also demonstrated to benefit the popular downstream application of cutting plane methods in Branch-and-Cut algorithm, which is the backbone of state-of-the-art commercial IP solvers."}

In this paper, we focus on securing in-vehicle CAN networks, proposing a novel automotive intrusion detection system (so-called VoltageIDS). The system leverages the inimitable characteristics of an electrical CAN signal as a fingerprint of the electronic control units. The noteworthy contributions are that VoltageIDS does not require any modification of the current system and has been validated on actual vehicles while driving on the road. VoltageIDS is also the first automotive intrusion detection system capable of distinguishing between errors and the bus-off attack. Our experimental results on a CAN bus prototype and on real vehicles show that VoltageIDS detects intrusions in the in-vehicle CAN network. Moreover, we evaluate VoltageIDS while a vehicle is moving."}

Anomaly-based IDS, in particular, rely on classification models trained using historical data to discover such malicious activities. In this paper, an improved IDS based on hybrid feature selection and two-level classifier ensembles are proposed. A hybrid feature selection technique comprising three methods, i.e., particle swarm optimization, ant colony algorithm, and genetic algorithm, is utilized to reduce the feature size of the training datasets (NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 are considered in this paper). Features are selected based on the classification performance of a reduced error pruning tree (REPT) classifier. Then, a two-level classifier ensemble based on two meta learners, i.e., rotation forest and bagging, is proposed. On the NSL-KDD dataset, the proposed classifier shows 85.8% accuracy, 86.8% sensitivity, and 88.0% detection rate, which remarkably outperform other classification techniques recently proposed in the literature. The results regarding the UNSW-NB15 dataset also improve the ones achieved by several state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, to verify the results, a two-step statistical significance test is conducted. This is not usually considered by the IDS research thus far and, therefore, adds value to the experimental results achieved by the proposed classifier."}

By incorporating deep learning into traditional RL, DRL is highly capable of solving complex, dynamic, and especially high-dimensional cyber defense problems. This article presents a survey of DRL approaches developed for cyber security. We touch on different vital aspects, including DRL-based security methods for cyber–physical systems, autonomous intrusion detection techniques, and multiagent DRL-based game theory simulations for defense strategies against cyberattacks. Extensive discussions and future research directions on DRL-based cyber security are also given.

The paper delivers insights gained during the early stages of the platform’s lifecycle (i.e. the platform design process). More specifically, it provides answers to three research questions, namely how alliance-driven MSPs come into existence and evolve, how different stakeholder groups use certain governance mechanisms during the platform design process, and how this process is influenced by regulatory instruments. By contrasting the case of an alliance-driven MSP with the more common approach of the keystone-driven MSP, the results of the case study suggest that different evolutionary paths can be pursued during the early stages of an MSP’s lifecycle. Furthermore, the IDS initiative considers trust and data sovereignty more relevant regulatory instruments compared to pricing, for example. Finally, the study advances the body of scientific knowledge with regard to data being a boundary resource on MSPs."}

Improvements to Intrusion Detection could be achieved by embracing a more comprehensive approach in monitoring security events from many different heterogeneous sources. Correlating security events from heterogeneous sources can grant a more holistic view and greater situational awareness of cyber threats. One problem with this approach is that currently, even a single event source (e.g., network traffic) can experience Big Data challenges when considered alone. Attempts to use more heterogeneous data sources pose an even greater Big Data challenge. Big Data technologies for Intrusion Detection can help solve these Big Heterogeneous Data challenges. In this paper, we review the scope of works considering the problem of heterogeneous data and in particular Big Heterogeneous Data. We discuss the specific issues of Data Fusion, Heterogeneous Intrusion Detection Architectures, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, as well as presenting areas where more research opportunities exist. Overall, both cyber threat analysis and cyber intelligence could be enhanced by correlating security events across many diverse heterogeneous sources."}

As a result, intrusion detection systems have been proposed to deal with network threats. The current mainstream intrusion detection algorithms are aided with machine learning but have problems of low detection rates and the need for extensive feature engineering. To address the issue of low detection accuracy, this paper proposes a model for traffic anomaly detection named a deep learning model for network intrusion detection (DLNID), which combines an attention mechanism and the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network, first extracting sequence features of data traffic through a convolutional neural network (CNN) network, then reassigning the weights of each channel through the attention mechanism, and finally using Bi-LSTM to learn the network of sequence features. In intrusion detection public data sets, there are serious imbalance data generally. To address data imbalance issues, this paper employs the method of adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) for sample expansion of minority class samples, to eventually form a relatively symmetric dataset, and uses a modified stacked autoencoder for data dimensionality reduction with the objective of enhancing information fusion. DLNID is an end-to-end model, so it does not need to undergo the process of manual feature extraction. After being tested on the public benchmark dataset on network intrusion detection NSL-KDD, experimental results show that the accuracy and F1 score of this model are better than those of other comparison methods, reaching 90.73% and 89.65%, respectively."}

The number of IoT devices in the world is increasing rapidly and it is expected that there will be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet by the end of the year 2020. This explosion of IoT devices, which can be easily increased compared to desktop computers, has led to a spike in IoT-based cyber-attack incidents. To alleviate this challenge, there is a requirement to develop new techniques for detecting attacks initiated from compromised IoT devices. Machine and deep learning techniques are in this context the most appropriate detective control approach against attacks generated from IoT devices. This study aims to present a comprehensive review of IoT systems-related technologies, protocols, architecture and threats emerging from compromised IoT devices along with providing an overview of intrusion detection models. This work also covers the analysis of various machine learning and deep learning-based techniques suitable to detect IoT systems related to cyber-attacks."}

The absence of any active therapeutic agents and the lack of immunity against COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of the population. Since there are no vaccines available, social distancing is the only feasible approach to fight against this pandemic. Motivated by this notion, this article proposes a deep learning based framework for automating the task of monitoring social distancing using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the YOLO v3 object detection model to segregate humans from the background and Deepsort approach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes and assigned IDs. The results of the YOLO v3 model are further compared with other popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution neural network) and single shot detector (SSD) in terms of mean average precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by object classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index term is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol. From the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort tracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score to monitor the social distancing in real-time."}

In this work, we propose a relational message passing method for knowledge graph completion. Different from existing embedding-based methods, relational message passing only considers edge features (i.e., relation types) without entity IDs in the knowledge graph, and passes relational messages among edges iteratively to aggregate neighborhood information. Specifically, two kinds of neighborhood topology are modeled for a given entity pair under the relational message passing framework: (1) Relational context, which captures the relation types of edges adjacent to the given entity pair; (2) Relational paths, which characterize the relative position between the given two entities in the knowledge graph. The two message passing modules are combined together for relation prediction. Experimental results on knowledge graph benchmarks as well as our newly proposed dataset show that, our method PathCon outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge graph completion methods by a large margin. PathCon is also shown applicable to inductive settings where entities are not seen in training stage, and it is able to provide interpretable explanations for the predicted results.

Traditional intrusion detection systems are no longer enough to detect these advanced attacks with unexpected patterns. Attackers bypass known signatures and pretend to be normal users. Deep learning is an alternative to solving these issues. Deep Learning (DL)-based intrusion detection does not require a lot of attack signatures or the list of normal behaviors to generate detection rules. DL defines intrusion features by itself through training empirical data. We develop a DL-based intrusion model especially focusing on denial of service (DoS) attacks. For the intrusion dataset, we use KDD CUP 1999 dataset (KDD), the most widely used dataset for the evaluation of intrusion detection systems (IDS). KDD consists of four types of attack categories, such as DoS, user to root (U2R), remote to local (R2L), and probing. Numerous KDD studies have been employing machine learning and classifying the dataset into the four categories or into two categories such as attack and benign. Rather than focusing on the broad categories, we focus on various attacks belonging to same category. Unlike other categories of KDD, the DoS category has enough samples for training each attack. In addition to KDD, we use CSE-CIC-IDS2018 which is the most up-to-date IDS dataset. CSE-CIC-IDS2018 consists of more advanced DoS attacks than that of KDD. In this work, we focus on the DoS category of both datasets and develop a DL model for DoS detection. We develop our model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and evaluate its performance through comparison with an Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Furthermore, we suggest the optimal CNN design for the better performance through numerous experiments."}

However, accurately estimating the post-click conversion rate (CVR) is challenging due to the selection bias, i.e., the observed clicked events usually happen on users' preferred items. Currently, most existing methods utilize counterfactual learning to debias recommender systems. Among them, the doubly robust (DR) estimator has achieved competitive performance by combining the error imputation based (EIB) estimator and the inverse propensity score (IPS) estimator in a doubly robust way. However, inaccurate error imputation may result in its higher variance than the IPS estimator. Worse still, existing methods typically use simple model-agnostic methods to estimate the imputation error, which are not sufficient to approximate the dynamically changing model-correlated target (i.e., the gradient direction of the prediction model). To solve these problems, we first derive the bias and variance of the DR estimator. Based on it, a more robust doubly robust (MRDR) estimator has been proposed to further reduce its variance while retaining its double robustness. Moreover, we propose a novel double learning approach for the MRDR estimator, which can convert the error imputation into the general CVR estimation. Besides, we empirically verify that the proposed learning scheme can further eliminate the high variance problem of the imputation learning. To evaluate its effectiveness, extensive experiments are conducted on a semi-synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/guosyjlu/MRDR-DL."}

Nevertheless, the flexibility provided by SDN architecture manifests several new design issues in terms of network security. These issues must be addressed in a unified way to strengthen overall network security for future SDN deployments. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network (GRU-RNN) enabled intrusion detection systems for SDNs. The proposed approach is tested using the NSL-KDD dataset, and we achieve an accuracy of 89% with only six raw features. Our experiment results also show that the proposed GRU-RNN does not deteriorate the network performance. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that the proposed approach exhibits a strong potential for intrusion detection in the SDN environments."}

Existing approaches focus on predicting all medications for the current visit, which often overlaps with medications from previous visits. A more clinically relevant task is to identify medication changes.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new recurrent residual networks, named MICRON, for medication change prediction. MICRON takes the changes in patient health records as input and learns to update a hid- den medication vector and the medication set recurrently with a reconstruction design. The medication vector is like the memory cell that encodes longitudinal information of medications. Unlike traditional methods that require the entire patient history for prediction, MICRON has a residual-based inference that allows for sequential updating based only on new patient features (e.g., new diagnoses in the recent visit), which is efficient.\n\nWe evaluated MICRON on real inpatient and outpatient datasets. MICRON achieves 3.5% and 7.8% relative improvements over the best baseline in F1 score, respectively. MICRON also requires fewer parameters, which significantly reduces the training time to 38.3s per epoch with 1.5× speed-up."}

Inertial measurement unit (IMU) can provide an accurate inertial navigation solution in a short time but its positioning error increases fast with time due to the cumulative error of accelerometer measurement. On the other hand, ultrawideband (UWB) positioning and navigation accuracy will be affected by the actual environment and may lead to uncertain jumps even under line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Therefore, it is hard to use a standalone positioning and navigation system to achieve high accuracy in indoor environments. In this article, we propose an integrated indoor positioning system (IPS) combining IMU and UWB through the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to improve the robustness and accuracy. We also discuss the relationship between the geometric distribution of the base stations (BSs) and the dilution of precision (DOP) to reasonably deploy the BSs. The simulation results show that the prior information provided by IMU can significantly suppress the observation error of UWB. It is also shown that the integrated positioning and navigation accuracy of IPS significantly improves that of the least squares (LSs) algorithm, which only depends on UWB measurements. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has high computational efficiency and can realize real-time computation on general embedded devices. In addition, two random motion approximation model algorithms are proposed and evaluated in the real environment. The experimental results show that the two algorithms can achieve certain robustness and continuous tracking ability in the actual IPS."}

Social media is increasingly used to share news and opinions about it. A realistic assessment of the situation is necessary to utilize resources optimally and appropriately. In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using IDs as provided by the IEEE data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library. The dataset is cleaned using the preprocessing techniques and sentiments are extracted using the TextBlob library. The contribution of this work is the performance evaluation of various machine learning classifiers using our proposed feature set. This set is formed by concatenating the bag-of-words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency. Tweets are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Performance of classifiers is evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. For completeness, further investigation is made on the dataset using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture of the deep learning model. The results show that Extra Trees Classifiers outperform all other models by achieving a 0.93 accuracy score using our proposed concatenated features set. The LSTM achieves low accuracy as compared to machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed feature set, the results are compared with the Vader sentiment analysis technique based on the GloVe feature extraction approach."}

As attackers continue to develop new types of attacks and the size of networks continues to grow, the need for an effective intrusion detection system has become critical. Numerous studies implemented machine learning algorithms to develop an effective IDS; however, with the advent of deep learning algorithms and artificial neural networks that can generate features automatically without human intervention, researchers began to rely on deep learning. In our research, we took advantage of the Convolutional Neural Network’s ability to extract spatial features and the Long Short-Term Memory Network’s ability to extract temporal features to create a hybrid intrusion detection system model. We added batch normalization and dropout layers to the model to increase its performance. Based on the binary and multiclass classification, the model was trained using three datasets: CIC-IDS 2017, UNSW-NB15, and WSN-DS. The confusion matrix determines the system’s effectiveness, which includes evaluation criteria such as accuracy, precision, detection rate, F1-score, and false alarm rate (FAR). The effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated by experimental results showing a high detection rate, high accuracy, and a relatively low FAR."}
