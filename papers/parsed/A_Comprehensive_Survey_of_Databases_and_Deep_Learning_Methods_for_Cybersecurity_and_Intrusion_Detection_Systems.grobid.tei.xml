<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>C YBERSECURITY systems have been of great impor- tance since the beginning of the computer network era. However, security attacks emerged even before that: in 1941, Alan Turing cracked the Enigma machine, which was designed to cipher messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Similar incidents have continued to occur through the present day; for example, the electrical system of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was hacked in 1950, Yahoo accounts were stolen in 2014, and several worldwide organizations were affected by the WannaCry worm in 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. According to the August 2019 threat reports from McAfee Labs, the top ten attack vectors at present are malware, account hijacking, unknown, vulnerability, unauthorized access, targeted attack, code injection, Denial of Service (DoS), defacement, and theft <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Hence, not only known but also unknown attack vectors currently pose a significant cyber threat.</p><p>The recent increase in the volume of data generated and transmitted over the internet, the need to manage the security of such data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and the continuing changes/evolution in intrusion types are causing both the academic and industrial communities to show increasing interest in the deployment of cybersecurity systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. To shield computer networks from attacks, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are being deployed to support user authentication, ensure safe access, and prevent loss of privacy. An IDS first collects and processes data and then applies a detection mechanism to raise alarms, which are sent to a human network analyst for further screening.</p><p>Different IDSs can employ diverse algorithms for detecting attacks. These algorithms can be classified into three categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>: i) rule-based algorithms, which use prior knowledge of attacks, such as the corresponding data distributions, to create a rule system and perform detection; ii) statistics-based algorithms, which detect anomalies by building a statistical distribution of intrusion patterns; and iii) Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches, in which learning algorithms are adopted to train classifiers that can distinguish among different types of attacks.</p><p>Rule-based methods, while simple and fast to execute, cannot compensate for incomplete or noisy data and are difficult to update. To overcome these problems, statisticsbased approaches have been proposed to enable the processing of imprecise information; however, such methods entail a high computational cost and have a limited ability to handle large quantities of data. Recently, ML-based approaches have increasingly been studied due to their ability to use complex inference models that can be trained on large quantities of data to detect complex intrusion patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Due to the increasing quantities of data transmitted over the internet, which are leading to the introduction of new networking paradigms (e.g., the Internet of Things -IoT, cloud computing, and fog/edge computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) and complex inference models (e.g., Deep Learning (DL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>), throughout the remainder of this paper, we will focus on ML-based approaches to cybersecurity and IDSs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Previous Surveys</head><p>This subsection introduces previous surveys published in the literature on cybersecurity, with a specific focus on ML-based methods. These surveys were chosen based on the criterion of being either the most cited or a pacesetter review on a specific topic. In this paper, in contrast to other surveys in the literature, we summarize existing surveys based on their strong points. The objective is to help readers find further material in accordance with their interests.</p><p>One of the most cited surveys in the literature is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This survey addresses the different ML methods used in IDSs; describes the structure of Internet Protocol (IP) traffic features, such as port-based, payload-based, and statistical features; and provides insight into feature categories such as packet-level and flow-level features. Although this review was performed using a limited number of papers published between 2004 and 2007 and some of the benchmark datasets described are now out of circulation, it presents valuable information on how to discover and extract novel IP-based intrusion patterns/features from network traffic. The review presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, in addition to describing the various MLbased methods of network intrusion detection, focuses on the characteristics of the types of intrusion. Therefore, this review presents how available statistical features can be used and modified for distributed attack detection and the importance of the threshold used to process these types of features.</p><p>In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the survey presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> focuses on the use of ML and Data Mining (DM) concepts in IDSs. This review includes a clear explanation of ML and DM algorithms introduced in highly cited papers published before 2016 as well as their usage in IDSs. Notably, this review does not include the newest DL methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); the newest datasets, such as AWID2018 and CICIDS2017; or practical details such as attack frequency and sample size for the benchmark datasets. Nevertheless, this review does consider fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and rule-based algorithms.</p><p>Similar to the survey presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the work reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> provides a review of ML methods for IDSs, associating different types of attacks with the features that can be used to detect them. In particular, the associated features can provide insight into how similar features of different types of intrusion can support similar approaches to attack detection. For example, the duration and service features from the KDD99 dataset are the most highly contributing features for detecting both User-to-Root (U2R) and Remote-to-Local (R2L) attacks, often causing these two attack types to be misclassified as one another. Although this paper fails to investigate the newest DL algorithms and attack types and their most related features, it provides an extensive survey of feature selection methods.</p><p>The review published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> surveys ML-based intrusion detection methods alongside newer DL-based methods. Although this survey focuses on certain specific ML and DL methods, such as Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), as well as known benchmark datasets, it does not cover other DL algorithms, such as CNNs, or benchmark datasets such as CICIDS2017. The reviews presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> also consider DL-based methods. However, they focus on only a subset of these methods, do not discuss benchmark datasets, or do not provide detailed descriptions of the accuracies achieved using DL methods.</p><p>In contrast to the previously mentioned surveys, the work presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> focuses on the different types of attacks rather than algorithms for IDSs, without providing details on accuracy. Furthermore, this paper presents an attack taxonomy to provide detailed definitions of various attack types, including how and in which layers they occur. Attack tools are also explained in great detail for readers who wish to build IDSs for protection against specific attack types. Although this paper does not provide detailed information about new benchmark datasets or DL algorithms, a brief review on industrial IDSs, such as programmable logic controller systems, is presented. Similarly, the review published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> addresses only application-layer Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, describing how they are hidden behind low traffic and the features used to detect DDoS attacks occurring in the application layer. Furthermore, this review discusses defense mechanisms for protecting against these attacks, such as user puzzles; the limitations of attempts to detect these attacks; and attack generation scenarios.</p><p>Finally, there are several surveys that address specific aspects or applications of IDSs. For example, the work reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> focuses on IDSs for IoT systems, describing their taxonomy and placement strategies. In a similar manner, the review presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> discusses DM concepts with IoT applications. Another example is the survey in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, which covers only unsupervised methods used in IDSs. Although this review is limited to unsupervised methods, it is a good reference for learning about a variety of feature selection methods. Additionally, datasets and EU standards (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation -GDPR) for data collection and protection are addressed in this review. Other reviews considering specific aspects of this field include the work described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which focuses on hardware techniques for IDS implementation; the paper presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which considers only immunity-based approaches; and the survey published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which describes network security techniques for supervisory control and data acquisition systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contributions</head><p>This work is intended to serve as an extensive survey of databases and methods based on ML and DL that have been introduced thus far in the literature on cybersecurity and intrusion detection. This survey focuses on papers published after 2013, with some exceptions being trendsetter algorithms or highly cited papers.</p><p>Compared to the other surveys on intrusion detection discussed in Section I-A, this survey makes three main contributions: i) it summarizes previous surveys with regard to their level of detail in describing methods for cybersecurity, with the purpose of encouraging further reading based on the readers' interests; ii) it focuses on a practical perspective when describing the relevant datasets, specifically addressing the number of features, the feature types, and attack distributions rather than describing general details, feature selection methods, and algorithms, which are analyzed in other surveys; and iii) it presents a comprehensive investigation of the newest DL methods for intrusion detection, analyzing their detection capability, performance, and limitations as well as the databases used. This review does not consider previous types of ML methods since they have been thoroughly addressed in other survey papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a review of cybersecurity datasets, including the data collection steps, feature and attack types, benchmark datasets, and reliability criteria. Section III reviews and analyzes DL-based intrusion detection methods, considering DBNs, Autoencoders (AEs), CNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Section IV provides a discussion of and insights into the limitations and current research trends regarding public datasets and IDSs. Finally, Section V concludes this work.</p><p>Table I summarizes the acronyms and notations used in this paper.</p><p>TABLE I LIST OF ACRONYMS AND NOTATIONS USED IN THIS PAPER Notation Description ML Machine Learning DL Deep Learning DM Data Mining IDS Intrusion Detection System IoT Internet of Things IP Internet Protocol TCP Transmission Control Protocol UDP User Datagram Protocol GDPR General Data Protection Regulation PCAP Packet CAPture SSH Secure Shell FTP File Transfer Protocol SQL Structured Query Language SYN TCP packet used to request a connection DoS Denial of Service DDoS Distributed Denial of Service U2R User-to-Root R2L Remote-to-Local XSS Cross-Site Scripting k-NN k-Nearest Neighbor ANN Artificial Neural Network SVM Support Vector Machine RBM Restricted Boltzmann Machine DBN Deep Belief Network AE Autoencoder CNN Convolutional Neural Network RNN Recurrent Reural Network LSTM Long Short-Term Memory GAN Generative Adversarial Networks PCA Principal Component Analysis</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CYBERSECURITY DATASETS</head><p>This section presents a review of cybersecurity datasets, outlining the data collection steps, feature and attack types, available benchmark databases, and reliability criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data Collection</head><p>This section presents the methods of data collection used in cybersecurity applications. Specifically, data collection can be performed in two different ways. The first is based on processing system calls (system logs) from host-based operating systems. The second is based on packet headers and payloads extracted from network traffic packages and from applications using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP communication stack <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>The two main methodologies used to collect network traffic in the second way are full Packet CAPture (PCAP) and the NetFlow protocol:</p><p>PCAP enables the collection of the most detailed data from a network because it involves the extraction of whole network packets (including packet headers) for all information being transmitted. In particular, the data collected from such packets include the packet size, protocol types, headers of flows, flags, source and destination IP addresses, and source and destination port numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, the information contained in the payload of a packet may be deleted or anonymized due to privacy issues. In fact, a packet payload may contain sensitive data such as private information, instant messaging conversations, or a history of visited websites. In most cases, a trade-off must be established between anonymizing payloads to protect user privacy and using all collected data to achieve accurate attack detection. This trade-off is especially important to consider in the</p><p>TABLE II PROGRAMS USED TO CAPTURE AND PREPROCESS NETWORK TRAFFIC Method Step Program Ref. PCAP Capture libPCAP [32] winPCAP [33] SNORT [34] Preprocessing Wireshark [35] tshark [36] tcpdump [37] networkminer [38] rapidminer [39] scapy [40] NetFlow Capture/Preprocessing Cisco NetFlow [41] nfdump [42] case of nonflooding attack types such as R2L and U2R attacks, which are performed using packet payloads. NetFlow enables the collection of summary information or certain predefined attributes related to the flow of packets in a network. Examples of the features that can be extracted include the number of packets in given a time period or the size of data transmitted over the network. Although data collection via NetFlow is more memory efficient than data collection via PCAP, only summary data are considered, and it is not possible to extract new types of features to address new needs. The most commonly used programs for performing PCAP are libPCAP, winPCAP and SNORT. In addition, several programs allow the preprocessing of PCAP files to extract different types of features. For example, such preprocessing programs include Wireshark, tshark, tcpdump, networkminer, rapidminer and scapy. The most commonly used programs for capturing and preprocessing NetFlow data are Cisco NetFlow and nfdump. Table II summarizes the various programs used to capture and preprocess network traffic using the PCAP and NetFlow methodologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Feature Types</head><p>This section examines the types of features extracted from the available datasets. Although new features are added when novel attack patterns are discovered, there are several reoccurring feature types in the literature.</p><p>First, a distinction can be drawn between host-based and network-based data based on the procedure used to collect the data, as described in Section II-A. In most cases, host-based data are composed of system/operation logs, which consist of attributes such as system calls. Feature extraction from system calls is generally performed using methods based on natural language processing, such as n-grams <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, network-based data are obtained by collecting network traffic data. However, network traffic is composed of many individual packets/frames, and feature extraction must be performed for each traffic session, known as flow-level traffic data, to reduce the dimensionality of the data and detect intrusions. Such feature extraction is conducted based on three different types of features: basic, traffic-based, and content-based features.</p><p>Basic features are extracted from TCP/IP connections and can be classified as header-based, flow-based, connectionbased, or packet-based features. Header-based features are related to the packet header and include the source and destination IP addresses, the TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) source and destination ports, the IP protocol, the service, and the IP header length. Flowbased features include attributes computed through analysis of the flow. In particular, a flow is defined as a set of packets having a common set of properties (flow keys), which may include IP addresses, port numbers, or meta-information <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>. Examples of flow-based features are statistical aggregations (e.g., average, maximum, minimum) on the size, time of arrival, and number of inbound/outbound packets in a given time period, the duration of that period, and the type of packets. Connectionbased features are related to a particular connection, which is defined as a stream of packets between two specific IP addresses. Such features include the interval between packets, the timestamp, and the time to live. Finally, packet-based features are related to the transmitted data and include the payload and mean number of bytes of a packet. The main advantage of basic features is that they are general and can be used to detect several kinds of attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>.</p><p>Traffic-based features are associated with either a specific time interval (e.g., 2 seconds) or a specific number of connections (e.g., 100 connections). These features can be extracted by considering either the same host or the same service. In the first case, the extracted features include statistical sums of connections with the same destination host, whereas in the second case, the extracted features comprise statistical sums of connections to the same service for a fixed amount of time or number of connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. One drawback of traffic-based features is that some attack types span time intervals longer than 2 seconds or a number of connections greater than 100. Examples of such attack types include low-frequency attack types such as U2R, R2L, and low-rate DoS attacks, in which the frequency of the transmitted information is similar to that of legitimate traffic, in contrast to high-frequency attack types, which exhibit a higher frequency than normal traffic. Although some newly proposed connection-based features span time intervals longer than 2 seconds, these features are not fully adequate for identifying such attack patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Content-based features are extracted from information embedded in different data portions of packets and include the number of requests, the request type, and the number of failed login attempts. Content-based features are especially useful for detecting low-frequency attack types, which do not exhibit sequential patterns as highfrequency attacks do. In fact, while traffic-based features can be used to detect high-frequency attacks, lowfrequency attacks are difficult to detect using only basic and traffic-based features, and in most cases, contentbased features are also required <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Attack Types</head><p>This section outlines the various attack types considered in IDSs. In particular, we present the following attack types, since they are the ones considered in the most frequently used benchmark datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>:</p><p>Denial of Service (DoS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> attacks are based on temporarily blocking the normal use of network utilities by flooding the network with traffic. Examples of DoS attacks include botnet, Slowloris, smurf, and SYN flood attacks. Distributed DoS (DDoS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> attacks are based on flooding the server and making it unable to respond by overloading it with service requests. Unlike in DoS attacks, the flooding is performed via many sources. Examples of DDoS attacks include local area network denial (LAND), ping-of-death, RUDY, and teardrop attacks. User-to-Root (U2R) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> attacks involve behaving as a normal user with the aim of detecting system vulnerabilities and gaining root access. Examples of U2R attacks include buffer overflow, rootkit, Perl, and loadmodule attacks. Remote-to-Local (R2L) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> attacks attempt to use a remote system to gain unauthorized access to and damage the target system. R2L attacks may be combined with U2R attacks, making these types of attacks difficult to differentiate. Examples of R2L attacks include Secure Shell (SSH) brute force, warezmaster, multihop, imap, and spy attacks. Probe <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> attacks are based on searching for vulnerabilities throughout the whole network by sending scan packets and gaining information about the system. Examples of probe attacks include Satan, IP sweep, and port sweep attacks. Password <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> attacks attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system by using guessing techniques to steal passwords. Examples of password attacks include brute force FTP-Patator and brute force SSH-Patator attacks. Injection <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref> attacks use scripts that inject commands/queries with the purpose of gaining unauthorized access and stealing information. Examples of injection attacks include SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).</p><p>Table III lists the attack types considered in the most frequently used benchmark datasets, along with their definitions.</p><p>Although the definitions provided in Table III can be used to distinguish the different attacks, three additional factors must be considered when designing an IDS. First, an attack of one type may be the beginning of another attack of a different type. In this case, the characteristics of the true attack will be a combination of the characteristics of both attacks. Second, some attack characteristics may evolve over time. For instance, DDoS attacks are mostly understood to be high-frequency attacks that flood the bandwidth of a network; however, DDoS attacks in the application layer are low-frequency attacks that flood the server instead of flooding the network. Third, some attack types may show similar patterns. For example, both DoS and probe attacks, in most cases, exhibit sequential patterns and involve a large number of connections to the same host, whereas R2L and U2R attacks are both embedded in packets. Therefore, although DoS and probe attacks are easy to differentiate from R2L and U2R attacks, it may not be as easy to differentiate DoS attacks from probe attacks or</p><p>TABLE III ATTACK TYPES REPRESENTED IN THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED CYBERSECURITY BENCHMARK DATASETS Attack name Examples Description Denial of Service (DoS) [45] Botnet, Slowloris, smurf, SYN flood Temporarily blocks the normal use of network utilities by flooding the network with traffic.</p><p>Distributed DoS (DDoS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> LAND, ping of death, RUDY, teardrop Floods the server and makes it nonresponsive to users by overloading it with service requests.

Password <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> Brute force FTP-Patator, brute force SSH-Patator Gains access to the system after stealing passwords by guessing.</p><p>Injection <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref> SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Uses a script to inject commands/queries to gain unauthorized access and steal information.</p><p>U2R attacks from R2L attacks due to their similar embedding patterns.</p><p>To increase the effectiveness of differentiating among attack types, several studies have investigated which types of features are effective for detecting particular attack types. For example, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> report that on the basis of the features contained in the KDDCUP99 dataset, even though DoS attacks can be differentiated using basic and traffic-based features, considering some sparse features, such as flags, destination IP addresses, percentages of connections to the same service, and percentages of connections to the same port, can result in more effective detection. Similarly, duration, service, destination host same service rate, and flag features are vital for detecting probe (scanning) attacks. The most important features for detecting U2R attacks are the number of failed logins, number of shells, number of roots, duration, and service. For R2L attacks, the most important features are the duration, service, service bytes, destination bytes, number of failed logins, count, destination host count, and destination host service count. As seen above, the features used to detect attacks of the probe, U2R, and R2L types show a high degree of similarity, which explains why these three attack types are often misclassified among each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Benchmark Datasets</head><p>This section introduces and analyzes benchmark datasets for intrusion detection, considering both the extent to which they reflect novel attack types due to the evolving nature of intrusion patterns over time and their shortcomings. For the benchmark datasets considered in this section, Table <ref type="table">IV</ref> lists the most frequently used datasets, while Table <ref type="table">V</ref> summarizes the distribution of the samples in each dataset across the different attack types considered.</p><p>1) AWID2018: Also known as CSE-CIC-IDS2018, this dataset includes databases for training and testing collected using two different capture procedures. The data collected using the first procedure consist of full-packet network traffic with system logs, while the data collected using the second procedure consist of reduced packet traffic. The dataset includes two different labels for attacks: a main attack label and a subattack label. This dataset has the advantages of including the newest attack types, such as password attacks based on the SSH/FTP brute force approach, injection attacks based on SQL injection, and flooding attacks based on DoS. However, the data exhibit some limitations, such as noisy, misleading features and uncategorized samples.

The dataset considers attacks and subattacks such as injection attacks based on SQL injection and XSS, password attacks based on brute force FTP-Patator and brute force SSH-Patator, and flooding attacks based on DoS, Goldeneye DDoS, HULK DDoS, slow HTTP DDoS, Slowloris DDoS, and Heartbleed.

The dataset includes 49 features and two label attributes: the first label describes the attack, and the second label is binary. The dataset considers attacks such as fuzzers, backdoors, shellcode, DoS attacks, worms, generic attacks, reconnaissance attacks, exploits, and analysis attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>.

The newer versions of the DARPA dataset, DARPA 1999 and DARPA 2000, are based on the 1998 version.

The dataset includes normal traffic data and attack data for attack types such as infiltration, DoS, DDoS, and brute force SSH attacks. Although this dataset includes some of the newest attack types, it is criticized as being unrealistic for not containing sufficient internet background noise, as it consists of pure network traffic rather than data received by any real device <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>. 9) CIC DoS: This dataset was created at the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity of UNB in 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>.

The dataset includes 5772 samples, each with 875+1+1 features. It includes distributed features often used in detecting low-frequency attacks, such as the number of packets and the total bytes in/out from four seconds to fifty-four seconds. In some cases, the features have been converted with the fast Fourier transform to increase their discriminative ability. This dataset has two attack label attributes: the first label discriminates between legitimate and malicious traffic, and the second label indicates whether the attack is based on buffer overflow.

One of the limitations of this dataset is duplicated packets.</p><p>16) CTU-13: This dataset is a combination of botnet traffic data, normal data, and background data collected at Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU) in 2011. Although the data consist of a variety of botnet scenarios and extended truncated versions of PCAP files with complete TCP, UDP and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) headers, the dataset is specifically designed only for botnet detection. Therefore, it is considered unrealistic to mix these data with normal and background traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>. 17) UMass: This dataset was collected between 2004 and 2018 and contains traffic data such as Tor traffic data, Gateway Link 3 Trace data, web requests, and response data.

In this dataset, some samples are left unlabeled, and informative data from the packet headers and payloads are anonymized <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[69]</ref>. This dataset has the limitation that traffic originating from honeypots does not represent realistic attacks since honeypots are designed to protect against less advanced attackers.</p><p>19) CAIDA: The CAIDA dataset consists of a variety of different databases that are specific to particular events, such as network telescope and DDoS databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[70]</ref>. Although there are a few up-to-date databases, such as CAIDA DDoS, most do not accurately represent the different possible types of attacks.

In addition, the ability to train DBNs using fast and unsupervised learning algorithms makes them particularly suitable for performing a preliminary dimensionality reduction step, with the aim of extracting a compact and discriminant representation of the data, without the need for labels, even in the case of large intrusion detection databases. For example, in the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[79]</ref>, proposed in 2011, a DBN was first applied to perform a feature reduction step, and an SVM was then used to classify the intrusions contained in the NSL-KDD dataset. Similarly, the approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[80]</ref> is based on a DBN, the parameters of which are first optimized via particle swarm optimization to map the input data to a space of reduced dimensionality.

Recently, however, the growing availability of computing power and GPU-based training architectures (e.g., CUDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[85]</ref>) has made it possible to train DL models using end-to-end learning algorithms based on gradient descent, without the need to approximate the gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Examples of recent DL models trained end to end include AEs, CNNs, LSTMs, and GANs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Autoencoders (AEs)</head><p>AEs are a type of ANN used to learn and reconstruct a representation of input data. In AEs, the same data are used as both input and target, with the purpose of learning a model that can extract a compact and discriminant representation of the input data in an unsupervised manner. Such a representation can then be used as input to a classifier to perform detection. An AE consists of two components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the input data to a hidden space in a nonlinear manner, and the decoder reconstructs the input data by mapping the encoded data back to the original input space. The purpose of the decoder is to minimize the reconstruction error, defined as the difference between the input data and the reconstructed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[73]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows an example of an AE.</p><p>Because of their ability to extract a compact and highly discriminative representation with reduced dimensionality from input data, AEs are often used as a preprocessing step in intrusion detection. In most cases, the related approaches presented in the literature involve using AEs to preprocess the input data, followed by the application of an ML classifier. In contrast to DBNs, AEs can be trained in an end-to-end manner using learning algorithms based on gradient descent, without the need to approximate the gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For example, in the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86]</ref>, an AE with seven layers is used to obtain a compact and discriminant representation of the input data. On the NSL-KDD dataset, this method achieves superior detection accuracy compared with other dimensionality reduction methods based on principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel PCA. Its main limitation is the lack of information about the shallow classifiers used to classify the data after the dimensionality reduction phase. Similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86]</ref>, the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[87]</ref> involves applying an AE to the input data to extract features, which are then classified using shallow classifiers such as naive Bayes, k-NN, and SVM classifiers. This work considers the NSL-KDD dataset and reports higher accuracy than that achieved by previous methods, particularly when using the naive Bayes classifier.</p><p>Several methods in the literature combine an AE with a density estimation model to achieve greater detection accuracy. For example, the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[88]</ref> adopts a combined approach based on an AE and density estimation. This method achieves a high detection accuracy on the NSL-KDD dataset, especially for DoS and probe attacks. The method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[89]</ref> extends the previous method by combining an AE with a Gaussian mixture model to perform intrusion detection. The model consists of an estimation network, which evaluates the densities of the samples in a low-dimensional space, and a compression network, which projects the data into a lowerdimensional space. A procedure based on joint parameter optimization is used to update the model parameters. On the KDD99 dataset, this method achieves a significant accuracy improvement compared to baseline methods using pretrained AEs.</p><p>A variant of AEs is represented by sparse AEs, which use a sparsity constraint to further reduce the dimensionality of the obtained representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[73]</ref>. Specifically, the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[90]</ref> uses a sparse AE combined with a softmax regression classifier to perform intrusion detection. The method achieves higher accuracy than previous models on the NSL-KDD dataset but considers only binary classification, differentiating between normal and anomalous traffic.</p><p>As the available computational power has increased, recent methods based on AEs have also considered Stacked AEs (SAEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[91]</ref>, which consist of several AEs trained separately and then "stacked" to obtain a deeper model and a more discriminant representation. The method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[92]</ref> uses a model based on an SAE to preprocess raw traffic data in the CTU-13 dataset. Similarly, the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[93]</ref> uses an SAE to process traffic data captured from home wireless networks, representing several types of DDoS attacks. To improve the detection accuracy, the method introduced in [94] combines an SAE with a random forest classifier. The method has been tested on the KDD99 and NSL-KDD datasets by reducing the feature dimensionality of the input data and performing five-class classification. The method achieves high overall detection accuracy but exhibits low accuracy in detecting U2R and R2L attacks. Similarly, the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[95]</ref> achieves high detection accuracy on the KDD99 dataset based on a combination of four AEs. Instead of using a random forest classifier, the method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref> combines SAEs with a radial basis function classifier to achieve high detection accuracy on the AWID2018 dataset.</p><p>Recently, one of the most commonly used types of AE models has been Variational AEs (VAEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[97]</ref>. Their main novelty is that, whereas AEs use a deterministic discriminative model, VAEs use a probabilistic generative model to reconstruct the input data. As a consequence, VAEs are less prone to overfitting than AEs are. In the field of intrusion detection, Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Example of a convolutional neural network (CNN). The layers perform subsequent processing by convolving the data with banks of filters. the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[98]</ref> combines VAEs with a gradientbased fingerprinting detection model. In this method, gradientbased fingerprints are first extracted from NetFlow data taken from the UGR16 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[99]</ref>, and VAEs are then applied for feature reduction. The work reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[100]</ref> presents a more comprehensive evaluation conducted by combining VAEs with several classifiers, such as naive Bayes, SVM, decision tree, and random forest classifiers. This method achieves good results on the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets, especially when using the decision tree and random forest classifiers.</p><p>Despite the ability of AE-based methods to automatically obtain a compact and discriminant feature representation that can be adapted to the input data, AEs have the drawback of requiring an additional ML model to perform classification based on the obtained feature representation. To compensate for this drawback, the use of CNNs is increasingly being considered in recent DL-based methods developed for IDSs. This is because CNNs can be trained to process input data to automatically learn a compact and discriminant representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> while simultaneously classifying the obtained representation into the corresponding attack types <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</head><p>CNNs are a type of ANN in which the layers are structured to process input data in the form of multidimensional signals such as images or three-dimensional volumes. The different layers in a CNN perform subsequent processing by convolving the data with banks of filters, with parameters typically learned via gradient descent. CNNs have the main advantage of performing classification while automatically learning data representations, without the need for a handcrafted feature extraction step <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[74]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[101]</ref>. Due to this advantage, CNNs have been successfully applied in several scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[102]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[105]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows an example of a CNN.</p><p>In addition to their advantage of automatically learning data representations, CNNs have been especially successful in processing data with the aim of learning discriminant spatial patterns among the features that are invariant to translation and shifting <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[101]</ref>. In the context of IDSs, the advantages of CNNs have been useful for classifying attack types by considering the relationships among the features while requiring minimal preprocessing of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, however, the vast majority of CNN architectures have been structured to process data in the form of images <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Therefore, to use a CNN for intrusion detection, a preprocessing step must be performed to transform the features into a two-dimensional format that can be processed by the CNN. Several methods have been proposed for transforming features into a two-dimensional format. For example, the preprocessing method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[106]</ref> converts feature attributes into binary vectors. The method converts symbolic attributes, such as flag, service, and protocol type attributes, into binary vectors using one-hot encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[107]</ref>. Then, continuous attributes are converted by performing min-max normalization, discretizing the normalized values into ten intervals, and applying onehot encoding. Finally, the obtained vectors are combined and reshaped to form a two-dimensional image. Similarly, the preprocessing approach presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[108]</ref> converts malware binaries into grayscale images. A malware file is first read as a vector of 8-bit binary numbers, and each binary number is then converted into its equivalent decimal value. Finally, the resulting decimal vector is reshaped into a two-dimensional grayscale image.</p><p>Recent preprocessing methods for CNN-based intrusion detection have extended grayscale image representations to consider multiple channels. For example, the new encoding method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[109]</ref> is designed to give equal weight to each feature, producing a feature representation with 24 bits for each pixel, similar to an RGB color image.</p><p>To accelerate the transformation process, some methods involve performing feature selection before converting the data into an image-based format. For example, in the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[110]</ref>, feature selection is applied via a genetic algorithm.</p><p>After the features are transformed into an image-based format, a CNN-based approach is applied to classify the obtained images and perform intrusion detection. Several such approaches have been proposed in the literature. Most of these CNN-based methods rely on a layer structure based on an existing architecture. In particular, several methods use architectures based on LeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[74]</ref>, ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[111]</ref>, GoogLeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[112]</ref>, or VGG-16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[113]</ref>. The LeNet architecture is used in the methods described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[114]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[118]</ref>, which achieve high detection accuracy, especially on the AWID2018 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[119]</ref>. Similarly, the ResNet and GoogLeNet architectures are used in the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[106]</ref>, which has been tested on the NSL-KDD dataset after preprocessing. Although satisfactory results are achieved on this dataset, detection rates are not reported for each class. The VGG-16 architecture is used in the method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[108]</ref>, which has been applied to the Malign Dataset and the Microsoft Malware Dataset. This method achieves almost the same accuracy as the winner of the Microsoft Malware Dataset Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[120]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to methods based on existing networks, there are some CNN-based methods for which innovative ML architectures have been proposed. For example, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[121]</ref> propose a novel CNN and present its application to the KDD99 dataset. The method achieves a high classification accuracy for five types of DoS attacks, exhibiting performance superior to that of naive Bayes and k-NN classifiers. An innovative architecture is also proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[122]</ref> based on a convolutional AE; however, this method has been tested only on a private dataset.</p><p>Methods based on CNNs have recently achieved high accuracy on several intrusion detection datasets due to their ability to simultaneously learn a compact representation of the input data and perform adaptive classification. However, CNNs are primarily useful for learning discriminant spatial patterns from input data, whereas they are not naturally suited for processing data in the form of time series with the intent of learning discriminant temporal patterns. To overcome this disadvantage, several recent methods have considered the use of LSTM networks, which are specifically structured for learning temporal patterns by processing new data while maintaining a memory of previous samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[75]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks</head><p>An LSTM network is a type of ANN based on an RNN in which the neurons are connected following a temporal sequence. However, in contrast to traditional RNNs, LSTM networks have a deeper structure of hidden neurons with the ability to maintain a memory of previous inputs for arbitrary intervals of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[75]</ref>. Due to this node arrangement, RNNs and LSTM networks are often used to process data in the form of time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[123]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows an example of an LSTM network.</p><p>The ability of LSTM networks to process time-series data has proven useful in the IDS context since datasets for cybersecurity and intrusion detection are often structured as sequences of features evolving over time. Due to this advantage, several intrusion detection methods in the literature are based on LSTM networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[124]</ref>. Among these methods, the approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[125]</ref> applies a three-layer LSTM network. It achieves high detection accuracies on the KDD99, ADFA-LD, and UNM datasets. Similarly, the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[126]</ref> uses a cascade of three LSTM network modules, combined using a voting mechanism, to achieve an increased intrusion detection accuracy.</p><p>To exploit both the accuracy of LSTM networks in processing time series and the capability of CNNs to extract spatial patterns from images, recent methods have increasingly considered combinations of LSTM and CNN architectures for intrusion detection. For example, the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[127]</ref> uses an LSTM network combined with a CNN to perform multiclass detection of anomalies in the KDD99 dataset. Similarly, the approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[128]</ref> uses both a CNN and a hybrid LSTM-CNN model to perform detection. In some cases, hybrid LSTM-CNN models have been developed based on existing architectures, such as the method developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[129]</ref>, which relies on a CNN designed based on the LeNet model. This method has been tested on recent databases, including CICIDS2017 and CTU-13.</p><p>Despite the ability of LSTM networks to natively process time-series data, the introduction of novel and advanced CNN architectures is shifting the attention of the research community towards the use of CNNs in a wider range of application scenarios, including the learning of temporal patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[130]</ref>. In fact, current research trends are increasingly focusing on CNN architectures that are deeper (e.g., ResNet) <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[111]</ref> or lighter in weight (e.g., MobileNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[131]</ref>) and on computing platforms specifically designed to accelerate the of such architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[85]</ref>. Consequently, CNN-based methods tend to outperform models based on recurrent architectures, such as LSTM-based models, in most cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[132]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</head><p>GANs are DL models that can learn and mimic the distribution of input data to generate synthetic samples with a strong resemblance to the original data. Specifically, a GAN is structured as a combination of a generator, which generates data starting from a random distribution, and a discriminator, which distinguishes real data from synthetic data. The generator and discriminator are trained in an alternating fashion until equilibrium is reached <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[76]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[133]</ref>. In most recent applications, the generator and discriminator of the GAN are structured as CNNs, with the consequence that recent GANs can generate synthetic image samples with a high degree of realism <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[134]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows an example of a GAN.</p><p>GANs have the main advantage of being able to learn the distribution of the input data in an unsupervised manner, that is, without requiring class labels. In the IDS context, this characteristic is useful for learning the characteristics of data distributions in specific situations (e.g., under normal conditions). Due to this advantage, many recent methods developed for IDSs use GANs trained on existing datasets to detect anomalies, where the training data include only data captured in specific situations. Among these methods, a CNN-based GAN is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[135]</ref> to learn the characteristics of data captured under normal conditions. Then, the method is used to detect anomalies by computing the distance between freshly captured data and normal data. To achieve faster detection, an algorithm is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[136]</ref> that improves the computational efficiency of the GAN described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[135]</ref> while achieving a similar accuracy on the KDD99 dataset.</p><p>Despite the ability of GANs to simulate input data distributions, the synthetic data generated from the learned distribution may be insufficiently realistic compared with the real data, and thus, manual (e.g., visual) inspection may be required to achieve good results. In the case of IDSs, such visual examinations of the feature vectors could be relatively difficult to perform compared with cases in which a GAN is used to generate images of known objects or people.</p><p>IV. DISCUSSION This section presents a discussion of the limitations, challenges, and research trends of the current databases and intrusion detection approaches for cybersecurity applications. In particular, we will focus on the issue of dataset reliability and on research directions regarding novel features for intrusion detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Dataset Reliability</head><p>The recent rise in the number of ML-based approaches, particularly those based on DL, has resulted in an increase in the accuracy of intrusion detection that can be achieved using state-of-the-art methodologies. However, the performance of DL-based methods strongly depends on the quantity and quality of the data available <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, with the consequence that the biases and limitations of the datasets used to train the models directly affect the reliability of the predictions.</p><p>Currently, although the majority of works focus on researching algorithms that can yield improved detection results, a few studies have been dedicated to evaluating the reliability of benchmark datasets. As a first step towards evaluating dataset reliability, the work proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[137]</ref> discusses the criteria for a reliable benchmark dataset, which concern the diversity of the traffic data, the diversity of the protocols, the volume of collected data, the diversity of the attacks considered, the inclusion of novel attack types, the inclusion of full payloads without anonymization, the presence or absence of informative features, the updatability, the consideration of realistic traffic, the extent of labeling, and the size of the feature set. Finally, any discussion of dataset reliability should consider the ability of a dataset to adapt to changes over time, for example, by mimicking statistically normal traffic in accordance with upcoming needs.</p><p>Similarly, the work described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref> proposes eleven criteria for assessing the reliability of a dataset for intrusion detection: i) attack diversity, ii) anonymity, iii) available protocols, iv) complete capture (with payloads), v) complete interaction, vi) complete network configuration, vii) complete traffic, viii) feature set, ix) heterogeneity (all network traffic and system logs), x) correct labeling, and xi) metadata (full documentation of data collection). In addition to complying with these criteria, a reliable dataset should also provide a means of anonymizing the payload information to guarantee users' privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Among the criteria considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[137]</ref>, attack and traffic diversity play a major role, since a limited diversity or a high imbalance among attack types might increase the bias of detection approaches towards specific situations. To limit the problem of model bias and enable accurate evaluation of detection algorithms, it is therefore crucial to consider datasets that are as free as possible from internal biases while also being sufficiently representative of real-world data. However, dataset bias has been considered mainly for the benchmark datasets used in the field of computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[138]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[139]</ref>, whereas there is no analysis in the literature of the bias of benchmark datasets for intrusion detection. Therefore, an evaluation of dataset bias for IDSs may contribute to a fairer assessment of the various algorithms that have been proposed in the field of cybersecurity.</p><p>In addition to dataset bias, a few works in the literature address other issues related to public benchmark datasets, such as repeated data, missing values, incorrect labeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[137]</ref>, or an optimistic number of false alarms due to considering specific situations in a nonrealistic way <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[140]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Novel Features</head><p>As the number of methodologies that are able to achieve high accuracy on known datasets increases, attack patterns tend to evolve to better cheat the existing IDSs. This evolution, which can arise in nonstationary environments, is known as concept shift and occurs as the definitions of attacks change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[141]</ref>.</p><p>For instance, the work presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[142]</ref> shows that some low-frequency DDoS attacks that appear in newer datasets exhibit a higher degree of similarity to normal traffic than do similar attacks in older datasets. As a consequence, in recent cases, some features are less effective in detecting such attacks than they are in detecting older attack patterns.</p><p>Therefore, it remains an open research issue to investigate whether the available features in known benchmark datasets are sufficient to achieve high detection rates even in the presence of changing attack patterns or whether it will be necessary to add new features to maintain a high level of detection accuracy.</p><p>V. CONCLUSION In this review, we have analyzed Machine Learning (ML)based approaches to cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems, with a specific focus on the most recent methods based on Deep Learning (DL), which represent the current state of the art for intrusion detection in network traffic. Specifically, we have considered methods based on deep belief networks, autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory networks, and generative adversarial networks. In contrast to previous surveys, this considers studies that use common benchmark datasets to ensure a fair evaluation and comparison of the proposed algorithms.</p><p>To provide a reference for how recent cybersecurity methods use benchmark datasets for intrusion detection, in this survey, we have also reviewed the main datasets used for this purpose by highlighting their potential for training effective MLbased algorithms. In particular, we have considered the data collection procedures, the distributions of feature and attack types, and dataset reliability criteria.</p><p>By providing a survey of ML and DL approaches, along with descriptions of the benchmark datasets considered when developing recent methods, this review aims to provide a practical road map for researchers in academia and industry working in the field of ML and DL for cybersecurity applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>(4.35%) Notes: N. samples = Number of samples; Perc. = Percentage; FTP-P. = FTP-Patator; SSH-P. = SSH-Patator; Web att. = Web attacks; Infiltr. = Infiltration; Heartb. = Heartbleed;</figDesc></figure>
