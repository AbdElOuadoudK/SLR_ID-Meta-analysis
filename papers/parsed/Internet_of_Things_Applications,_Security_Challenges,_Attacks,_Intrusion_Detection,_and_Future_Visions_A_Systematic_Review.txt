I. INTRODUCTION

Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging field of collection and transfer of data without human intervention. It is referred to as a system of connected objects embedded with sensors, software, control systems. Technological advances such as machine learning have resulted in the evolution of IoT technology . IoT applications are increasingly making their presence felt in almost every area. Some of the widespread applications of IoT are shown in Fig. . In the present era, every sector is moving towards connected things to meet the world's pace. Education is not limited to the traditional way; now classrooms are connected, and with the use of The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Jiafeng Xie.

technology, differently-abled students with hearing issues can learn using connected gloves and tablets. Similarly, IoT technology can turn out to be a significant boon for other disabled students. In fast-running lives, homes and cities are getting smart to fulfill humankind's basic needs such as security, waste management, air quality improvement, and entertainment .

The healthcare sector has transformed with the introduction of IoT, be it wearables or telemedicine and remote monitoring of patients . IoT in agriculture has changed the way of traditional farming with better water management and soil monitoring . IoT has been a game-changer in smart vehicles by introducing connected vehicles . Also, in electric grids introduction of IoT has given energy management new heights . IoT has evolved into this big industry after This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see many advancements; the chronological advancement of IoT is depicted in Fig. . From the internet-enabled refrigerator to IoT-based smart city , the industry has come a long way, and it has become an integral part of everyday lives. IoT has marked its presence in the defense sector by introducing the Internet of Battlefields in 2017, and in the subsequent year, it was introduced in the healthcare sector. In the year 2005, the first Wi-Fi enabled rabbit was manufactured in Japan . 2011 was a milestone year for IoT as it was added in the Hype cycle of emerging technologies; later on, it has been frequent in the Hype cycle and even recently in 2017, IoT remains at the peak of hype in Gartner cycle . The focus is now shifting towards IoT security after the first large-scale IoT-based attack in 2016 . Fig. represents a variety of research challenges associated with growing IoT devices. The security protocols are not unified. Each device has a particular solution depending on the vendor. Also, as the IoT network is comprised of heterogeneous devices, protocols are not standardized. Traditional security methods do not work with IoT devices because they have a small processor, and adding security becomes impractical. Power resources and the location is also a concern for implementing security techniques. Mobility is a significant concern for connected cars, i.e., in smart automobiles . In other applications where mobility is low, achieving trust is comparatively more comfortable than in fast-moving connected vehicles. IoT devices face significant Resource Constraint challenges as there are multiple facet constraints for IoT: cost, power, size. Heterogeneity of IoT devices is another major issue as most IoT applications work in a distributed environment with sensors, actuators, and other devices . Table represents various IoT-related open Issues and research challenges. These challenges make industry players skeptical about using IoT technology. Governments have not come up with a standard framework and regulation for IoT, giving freehand to service providers for implementing IoT. This creates a challenge in coming up with a common platform for any IoT solution. Expectations are on the rise from IoT in terms of performance with technological advancements, specifically artificial intelligence and data engineering.

TABLE 1. IoT research challenges.

Similarly, interoperability is required as connected devices are increasing and common platforms are less for IoT. The connectivity issue is of concern as several highly critical IoT devices are involved in data transfer. Maintaining reliable data transfer for heterogeneous IoT devices poses a serious technical challenge.

The security requirement is essential in the case of IoT to maintain trust among consumers. Security management takes a back seat in IoT because of cost, size, and power. This consequently makes IoT vulnerable to security attacks, ultimately causing enormous financial and reputational losses. Research Contributions: In the literature, several surveys are available; key contributions of some of the highly cited research works are represented in Table .

II. SECURITY ISSUES IN IoT DOMAIN

Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly growing in numbers, and lack of security in these devices has resulted in transforming IoT devices into a hotbed for malicious activities . Fig. represents various cybersecurity attacks that can impact IoT layers such as the Perception layer, Support layer, Network layer, and Application layer. A widely accepted four-layered design is considered in the conducted review work .

PERCEPTION LAYER: The perception layer comprises sensors and actuators . Sensors sense the environment around them while actuators act as controllers to take action based on sensed data. Sensors are also known as nodes, and these are vulnerable to node capturing attacks where an attacker may either capture the node or replace it with a malicious node. The over the air update of these nodes' firmware or software gives the attacker a chance to inject malicious or false code in the node causing Malicious code injection or False data injection attacks . TABLE 3. Classification of referenced articles based on surveyed topics.

Side channel attack based on laser, power consumption, and timing can occur in this layer . The nodes present in an open environment are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks at the time of data transmission or similar events . IoT devices are power constraint, and the attackers exploit this issue by draining the power source and causing Sleep deprivation. Typically, IoT devices' security process is enabled after booting, giving the attacker opportunity to launch an attack at boot time.

NETWORK LAYER: The network layer sends information from the sensing layer for further processing to the computational unit. This layer is highly vulnerable to attacks comprising several IoT devices . Phishing attack targets several IoT devices in an attempt to at least take control of a few of them . In a DDoS attack, an attacker tries to overwhelm the target by sending spoofed requests. IoT devices act as botnets in DDoS attacks and can create a massive flood of requests to deny the target further access to resources . Worm-hole, Sinkhole attacks are examples of Routing attacks in which the attacker tries to route the traffic to a different path by gaining access to nodes . At the time TABLE 5. A representation of various type of DDoS attacks.

SUPPORT LAYER: The Support layer acts between Network and Application layer. This layer helps in resource allocation, computing, and data storage. Security of database is essential at this layer, and it is prone to DDoS, Man-in-themiddle, SQL injection kind of attacks. A broker like MQTT protocol is used for communication between client and service provider. In a Man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker takes control of the broker, thus controlling all the communication . The target of attack in the Support layer is usually to access data; therefore, database and cloud security are crucial in this layer.

APPLICATION LAYER: The application layer contains smart applications viz. smart city, smart home, healthcare, and more. This layer directly deals with end-users; hence privacy and data theft are major concerns at this layer . Similar to other layers, this layer is also affected by the Malicious code injection attack. A service interruption attack is similar to a denial of service attack as it causes service disruption. Some users are given the unique privilege to allow legitimate user access at the time of an attack, but the whole system can come under attack if this access is compromised. This makes access control attack one of the major concerns at the application layer . Sniffing attack takes place with the help of sniffing tools where attacker sniffs network traffic data, and confidential data is compromised in this attack .

A. DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICES (DDoS) ATTACKS

The DDoS attack, as the name suggests, is launched to overwhelm the target and disrupt services. The DDoS attack requires a large number of devices for launching an attack, and for this, IoT devices are well suited. As in most cases, users will not understand that the device is compromised; for example, baby monitors and smart toys have a user interface with limited access. They may generally work even after being part of a Botnet army. With the increasing volume of IoT devices, there is an urgent need to detect attacks timely to remove compromised devices. IoT devices were used as Botnets by Mirai in a significant DDoS attack, and also several such attacks have taken place . Table represents a comparative analysis illustrating three categories of DDoS attacks.

The severity of DDoS attacks can be understood from Fig. , which comprises major DDoS attacks from 2013 to 2020. Leading service providers like Amazon Web Services have been the victim of DDoS attacks. KrebsOnSecurity, Cloudflare, AWS, and more DDoS attack victims are themselves security providers against such attacks , . Therefore, as shown in Fig. , attacks on these major establishments hamper companies financially and impede their reputation. In a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, the attacker tries to disrupt the services of the target by utilizing its resources with the help of fake requests.

Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is an amplified DoS attack. In a DDoS attack, requests are initiated from many sources, and hence it is named as distributed DoS. Due to this, it becomes challenging to mitigate DDoS attacks. There are many types of DDoS attacks: TCP SYN Flood attack, Teardrop attack, Smurf attack, Ping of Death attack, Botnets. DDoS attacks can also be classified as Reflection and Amplification attacks. In a reflection attack, the size of the request and response is the same , whereas, in an amplification attack, the size of the response is many times bigger than that of the request . In Table , the chronological evolution of DDoS attack vectors is depicted.

B. DDoS ATTACK IN IoT DEVICES

DDoS and DoS attacks differ in the attack surface used to launch the attack. In a DDoS attack, multiple systems are used to launch the attack. These systems might be desktops, servers, IoT devices, and other connected devices . Gaining access to these devices is the first step to launch an attack. The attackers exploit vulnerabilities of devices for taking control. In IoT, there are several security concerns that attackers are actively abusing .

Common vulnerabilities exploited by attackers for launching an attack using IoT:

VOLUME 9, 2021 TABLE 6. A representation of the evolution of DDoS attack vectors.

INSECURE CONNECTION:

Connected devices are used for launching attacks, and it becomes a cakewalk for the attacker to infect a device when there is no firewall at work.

2. WEAK PASSWORD: Brute force attack comes into action when passwords are weak. In IoT, especially companies tend to keep the default password same for all the devices, and if not changed by the device user, it becomes effortless for the attacker to infect the device. Due to this practice, attackers try to find out more devices from the same manufacturer after successfully infecting some of a particular manufacturer's devices.

3. FIRMWARE UPDATES: Most IoT devices remain insecure because of outdated firmware. In some cases, the firmware update is not secure, which can leave the device unprotected.

4. SOFTWARE VULNERABILITIES: Software-related vulnerabilities remain on the watch list of attackers before the manufacturer releases any patch. These vulnerabilities are

TABLE 7. A detailed analysis indicating why IoT is preferred over other devices for DDoS attacks.

usually exploited by skilled attackers as these are difficult to identify and exploit.

5. VULNERABILITIES IN DATA HANDLING: Data transfer is a crucial step for connected devices, and at this phase, any loophole in the connection to the cloud or server can very well be exploited by the attacker.

A detailed analysis indicating the cause of preference of IoT devices over other devices is presented in Table . Conventional devices are usually secure as compared to IoT devices because of traditional security practices. This specifies the reason behind the drastic increase in IoT attack surface.

For launching a DDoS attack, the attacker runs malware scripts and tries to find out vulnerable devices. This process is similar in the case of IoT and other devices. It is a bit easier for the attacker to infect IoT devices because of a lack of security . Once the attacker achieves access to these devices, unpretentious devices get mutated to bots, and the collection of these devices is called a botnet . This botnet army can further be used for launching an attack by the master, or the master can decide to sell the army of bots for the use of other malicious actors. The DDoS attack, as shown in Fig. , takes place when multiple requests are sent using a botnet army, ultimately overwhelming the victim.

TABLE 8. Comparative analysis of IDS And IPS systems.

All the servers are designed to handle a particular number of requests at a time, and attackers try to reach this threshold and exceed that by an enormous amount to overwhelm and ultimately deny the server to perform further . IoT devices are exploited by attackers because of software, hardware, physical vulnerabilities. Along with these vulnerabilities, IoT devices use protocols that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks, viz. CoAP, RPL, 6LoWPAN .

III. INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM

As we move into the era where almost everything being used by humans will be connected to the internet, the security of these devices becomes paramount. Two major solutions are found in the literature for preventing DDoS attacks, namely Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). IDS is a precautionary measure where the system itself takes no action in case of intrusion; instead, an alarm is raised. IPS is the punitive measure where an action is taken by the system in case of intrusion . In IPS, an issue arises in the case of false positives as legitimate users can also get blocked. Table represents a detailed comparative analysis of IDS and IPS systems.

Further in this study, IDS is focused upon as false alarm rate is a significant concern in malware classification. Also, punitive action taken on legitimate users can ruin the whole reason for creating a detection system. Fig. represents a graphical representation of the category of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Based on the target location, it can be classified as Host-based, Network-based, or Hybrid IDS. Host-based IDS is specific to a system, detection of an inside intruder is strong, and it can very well assess the extent of the compromise, but it is expensive as one IDS is required per host . In Network-based IDS, the outside intrusion is very well detected, and it can protect all hosts, but there is too much traffic to analyze . Hybrid IDS is flexible and provides more security as it combines features of both Host-based and Network-based IDS . In Active IDS, definite action is taken for certain alerts, whereas only reports are generated, or alarms are raised in Passive IDS. Centralized IDS use individual monitors for monitoring each host, as it does not scale according to requirement, thus providing less flexibility. Moreover, centralized IDS is prone to a single point of failure. Distributed IDS, on the other hand, works as a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, and in this case, each monitoring unit doubles up as an analysis unit as well.

A. ANOMALY DETECTION TECHNIQUES

Two major approaches being used for Malware Detection are Signature-based Detection and Anomaly-based Detection. The signature-based detection technique is not reasonably successful in the case of Botnets as Botnets keep on mutating, and as a result, Bot signature also keeps on changing. These techniques are not useful in real-world situations when the target is to detect new variants of Botnets. Anomaly-based detection techniques , on the other hand, are quite popular, as these techniques presume that Botnet traffic will be behaviorally different from normal traffic.

There are some other approaches, like Community Base Anomaly Detection , where Bots are identified using Communication Graph; for this to work accurately, a full graph should be available. Particular protocols/structures are also used for detection in a research study, but this approach is not practical if the same structure is not operated by other Botnets . Bad Neighborhood is also one of the methods used in Spam and Phishing Detection; it is defined as a cluster of IP addresses that perform malicious activities over a certain period. Moura et al. used this approach for IPv4 attacks and generated a blacklist of IPs.

This approach is not entirely practical as DDoS attacks are widespread, and it is challenging to assign clusters for blacklisting. Another method is whitelisting IPs, as Yoon , where a VIP list is created assuming that VIPs will log in from a particular IP address, i.e., IP address not very dynamic for personal laptops. This way, critical people can still use the websites which are under DDoS attack. This approach is also not very useful as it may only benefit a small set of people. Several Anomaly detection techniques are present in the literature. Table represents a detailed comparative analysis of different Anomaly detection techniques. As seen from the Table, the machine learning-based approach is advantageous and is accepted globally for a wide range of malware classification. Therefore, the undertaken study focuses on the machine learning-based approach. FIGURE 10. Confusion matrix.

B. PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR IDS

Some of the predominantly used performance metrics for Intrusion Detection Systems are discussed below.

1) CONFUSION MATRIX

Confusion Matrix (CM) is not directly a performance measure in itself. Still, it is one of the most instinctive metrics for defining a classification model's correctness. Almost all performance metrics are computed using CM parameters.

In Confusion Matrix, there are two ways to reduce errors: reducing False Negatives and reducing False Positives. There is no set rule for the same, and it depends on the requirement. For instance, for email spam classification, False Positives should be minimized, and for cancer patient classification, false negatives should be minimized.

2) ACCURACY

Accuracy is defined as the number of correct predictions over total predictions. This metric is ideal for use in the case of a balanced dataset. When there is a majority class in a dataset, the results provided by this metric may not reflect the model's actual performance.

3) PRECISION

Precision is a measure to calculate the Machine Learning Model's accuracy in finding the number of actual positives out of total predicted positives. This metric is useful when False Positive is of high cost for Model quality, for example, email Spam Detection Model.

4) RECALL/SENSITIVITY

Recall is a measure to calculate the Machine Learning Model's accuracy in finding the number of positives out of total actual positives. This metrics is useful when False Negative is of high cost for Model quality, for example, Fraud Detection Model.

5) F-1 SCORE

It is calculated as a Harmonic Mean of precision and recall metrics to better evaluate model performance. This is a metric of importance for an imbalanced dataset as in this; equal importance is given to both Precision and Recall. TABLE 9. Comparative analysis of anomaly detection techniques. 7) AUC-ROC CURVE Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a measure to determine the stability between precision and recall by a varying threshold. The Area Under Curve (AUC) represents the quality of the classification model. True Positive Rate (TPR) = TP TP + FN . . . (6) False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP FP + TN . . .

It is a curve between TPR, i.e., Recall (Sensitivity), and FPR, i.e., (1 -Specificity). In general, AUC near to one represents a better classification model. Several other metrics are also used in the performance evaluation of IDS, namely the KAPPA metric, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and many more, depending on the requirement.

IV. REVIEW OF STEPS INVOLVED IN IDS A. REVIEW OF VARIOUS DATASETS IN IDS

Data can be collected in two ways in IDS: first by using existing datasets else by creating own dataset. There are several datasets being extensively used for Anomaly Detection. KDD-99 is one of the oldest and extensive dataset, and despite it being highly imbalanced, it is used even now due to the lack of its alternatives. NSL-KDD was created to remove the issues associated with KDD-99. It is one of the benchmark datasets used for Anomaly detections regardless of whether it is obsolete, as the attacks incorporated in this dataset are mostly outdated. The skewedness of KDD-99 and NSL-KDD is almost removed in UNSW-NB15 , , consisting of 49 features and 10 target classes, whereas KDD consists of 41 features and 5 target classes. For Botnets, CTU-13 having 13 scenarios; each of different Botnet samples is being used nowadays. A separate malware is executed for each capture, which performs different actions using different protocols. ISOT is also one of the popular datasets , particularly for IoT Botnet attack databases. A detailed review of some of the popular existing network-based datasets is represented in Table . There are some tools and techniques available for creating own dataset in the literature.

Wireshark is used to capture and present network traffic. Detection rates achieved are high as DoS tools produce quite predictable traffic. Spleen is a software tool for creating a dataset similar to DARPA . In this application, some additional features can also be added for better functionality.

CICFlowmeter is a java based tool used for extracting network features from raw network captures. It captures a set of 80 features and prepares a pcap or CSV file to be used for further analysis. Sharafaldin et al. created two networks: 1.) Victim-Network consisting of 3 servers,1 firewall, 2 switches, and 10 PCs, 2.) Attack-Network includes one router, one switch, and four PCs. This kind of network is generally used for data generation. Dataset generated in this work contains attacks based on McAfee report 2016. This dataset's shortcoming is the number of systems used is less, and it needs to be updated for more recent attacks, and more Botnet attack data should be used. Commercial IoT devices were infected in the lab using Mirai and Bashlite Botnets by Meidan et al. to launch an attack. The network is sniffed using port mirroring on the central switch, and data is recorded using Wireshark. Djanie et al. used eight DoS attack tools for launching an attack on a Virtual Ubuntu 19 Machine. For identifying a suitable dataset for research work, the number of records plays a crucial role. Fig. depicts the bar chart representation of the number of attack records in Percentage. As shown in Fig. , some of the datasets like KDD-99 consist of many attack records, i.e., .14% in the training set and 80.52% in the test Whereas some of the datasets like CDX 2009 consists of smaller number of attack records, i.e., 0.76%. B. REVIEW OF VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN IDS Data pre-processing comprises several steps: adding missing values, normalizing data, removing unwanted features/outliers. Feature analysis and extraction is the backbone of any Machine Learning Model. For feature extraction, different optimization techniques are used by researchers: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Boosting Algorithms. Machine learning techniques are mainly used for feature engineering as they are lightweight and less complicated . Botnet analysis has two major subdivisions, specifically Flow-based traffic analysis and Graph-based traffic analysis . These analyses differ mainly on the feature selection part as statistical features are selected for Flow-based analysis; otherwise, Graph-based features are chosen. Usually, the same set of features are extracted for different time windows to create a real-time scenario . These are statistical features and can be highly useful for capturing malicious activities as features indicate anomaly if the behavior is unseen, which happens in the case of a spoofed IP address. A botnet can be Detected using Graph-based features, as done by Chowdhury et al. .

In this detection, efficiency was improved by removing inactive nodes, and detection methodology was given, where, by using only six nodes, Bots can be detected effectively. Features are selected by Ghasemi et al. using a genetic algorithm. For each class, a two labeled dataset is created, which is then given to classifiers, and after applying the voting mechanism best classifier is predicted, and a new dataset is created where number of classes is equal to the number of columns. This dataset is further used for the training model; this way model will be trained for different behaviors of all classes. Some of the critical data pre-processing techniques based on machine learning are discussed in Table .

In Intrusion Detection System, classification and clustering algorithms are used extensively. On network traffic, data classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) , , Decision Tree , , KNN have given important and powerful results. Incremental Learning is one of the recent techniques being used with machine learning techniques for real-time results. It is often used in image classification , target recognition , and used less in Intrusion Detection or information security. SVM is one of the most prevalent techniques being used in Incremental Learning. An incremental SVM Learning algorithm based on Incremental Clustering for Intrusion Detection is proposed by Du et al. . Yi et al. used a kernel function modified for incorporating Mean and Mean Square

TABLE 10. A detailed review of various network-based datasets. Value of attributes to develop an upgraded Incremental SVM algorithm, which solves the oscillation problem of follow-up learning process of Incremental Incremental Learning is used by Zhuang et al. for proposing a Malware Detection algorithm to preserve support vectors obtained from old data of SVM. Intrusion Detection is done using Incremental Multiclass SVM by Li et al. . Although using Incremental Learning is required for real-time detection, here small dataset is used, so the sample size used for classification is significantly less, and SVM performance is not suitable for such scenarios. Online and Real-time version of unsupervised network anomaly detector is introduced using Incremental Grid Clustering for Intrusion Detection by Dromard et al. .

Results in the study demonstrate the scalability of the algorithm and can be used online. It uses a time sliding window, which is discrete for traffic collection. Speed is a bit slow, which can be improved using a better streaming tool. A synthetically generated log file is used; the applied algorithm learns by itself, creating clusters in sliding time as presented by Landauer et al. .

In this, false positives were detected in large amounts, which remains a big problem in Real-Time Anomaly Detection. Yang et al. extracted features using damped Incremental statistics in place of a commonly used time sliding window, which reduced memory consumption. Incremental Possibilistic clustering (IPC) is used to detect outliers as new centers for clusters and use Mahalanobis distance for merging clusters. Various Genetic algorithms are used for anomaly detection. There is a recent shift of focus on swarm intelligence, which is used for optimization. For optimizing hyperparameters, different techniques are used by researchers. Shorman et al. achieved impressive results using Grey Wolf Optimization for tuning the hyperparameters of one-class support vector Machine (OCSVM) and selecting the best Botnet features.

Table 12 represents a detailed

review of significant machine learning-based malware detection techniques.

C. REVIEW OF VARIOUS DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN IDS

Deep learning techniques are being extensively used for feature engineering because of their ability to learn high-dimensional features. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is one of the most common feature engineering techniques, specifically for their application in synthetic data creation and learning better about minority classes. Ferdowsi et al. used GAN for feature engineering as well as detection. In this study, a distributed GAN is proposed to provide a fully distributed IDS for the IoT to detect anomalous behavior without reliance on any centralized controller. Learning more about the characteristics of the minority class seems to have improved the performance of classifying normal classes since the characteristics are significantly different from those of other classes, as depicted by Lee et al. by deploying GAN for feature engineering. Features engineering is achieved using the Flow Wasserstein GAN model and Attention GRU Model by Han et al. . An attention model is used to detect the payload-based attack. Yang et al. used a Supervised adversarial Variational autoencoder for feature engineering. Regularization is achieved using Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty. The advantage of SAVAER DNN is that it can effectively detect lower frequent attacks along with frequent attacks. Taylor Series is used along with Elephant Herd Optimization (TEHO) to train Deep Belief Network .

Deep networks' training time issue is resolved in this study by using Bhattacharya Distance for feature classification. Jiang et al. addressed the issue of Data imbalance by

TABLE 12. A detailed review of various machine learning-based Malware detection techniques.

using One-Side Selection (OSS) to reduce noise in majority classes and synthetically enhancing minority classes with the help of the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling (SMOTE) technique. In this study, CNN is used for extracting spatial features, and BiLSTM for extracting temporal features. Simple feedforward neural networks are used as weak learners for feature engineering by Nabil et al. . Binary classification is achieved in this study, and neural networks are used as specialized networks for a subset of features. Table represents a detailed review of the critical Deep Learning based data pre-processing techniques.

Supervised Learning based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is used by Martin et al. . A new algorithm is used, which can also be applied in Online Learning. The response is very fast in DRL. Four DRL techniques, namely DQN, DDQN, Policy gradient, and Actor critic, are used in this work. Out of these, DDQN gives the best results. The results are also compared with existing Machine Learning algorithms. Sparse Autoencoder and Outlier detection method is used. This method can forecast IoT Botnets in advance, making it easier to detect and mitigate the attack, as shown by Kumar and Bhama . Restricted Boltzmann Machine is used by Otoum et al. for feature engineering and detection. The study indicates that RBC IDS and adaptively supervised and clustered hybrid IDS achieve the same detection and accuracy rates. However, the detection time of RBC IDS is approximately twice that of ASCH IDS. Wei et al. used Deep Belief Network for feature engineering and Deep Belief Network and Particle Swarm Optimization for detection. In this study, an optimal network VOLUME 9, 2021

structure is acquired by comparing the DBN structure obtained five optimization algorithms. et al. normalized features manually and used RNN as a classifier. The detection rate achieved for DoS and Probing attacks was higher as compared to R2L and U2R attacks. This due to the property of RNN of working well with time-series tasks, and DoS and Probing attacks have more obvious timing characteristics than R2L and U2R attacks. LSTM and Autoencoder classifiers are used as an ensemble by Zhong et al. . This heterogeneous ensemble learning ensured that the model has better adaptability and accuracy when compared with other methods. The study by Muhuri et al. shows that the performance of the LSTM-RNN model is better in binary classification as compared to multiclass classification. In binary classification, the proposed model outperforms SVM and RF models. In multiclass Classification, RF outperforms the LSTM-RNN model, as minority attack types do not show obvious timing characteristics. A study done by Hsu et al. shows that after applying CNN, accuracy increases considerably when compared with only LSTM model. Some of the noteworthy Deep Learning based detection techniques are depicted in Table .

Parra et al. proposed a model working on two security mechanisms simultaneously. A distributed convolutional neural network is used to secure IoT devices at the origin of attack. At the back-end, the LSTM model is used. Using two models in tandem reduces the resource and communication requirement. Lee et al. compared LSTM, CNN, MLP, Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) for detecting attacks based on packet length in SDN switch. Results show that MLP performs best. The reason might be the choice of number of layers as in this work for LSTM, only one layer is used, and three layers were used for all others. The results obtained vary accordingly. Bots are utilized to send traffic to the victim at comparatively lower speed in link-flooding attacks. These attacks are defended by Chen et al. using an ensemble of CNN and LSTM models. The link-flooding DDoS attacks are difficult to mitigate; LSTM is utilized in this work to review the attack patterns periodically. For a similar low rate DDoS attack pattern in wireless systems, Liu and Yin used a combination of LSTM and CGAN. This is because LSTM works well in identifying patterns in sequenced packages.

The study by Zavrak and Iskefiyeli shows that Variational Autoencoder gave similar ROC curves for the attacks displaying similar behavioral characteristics. Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) was used by Hara and Shiomoto as a semi-supervised learning technique to address the issue of more extensive labeled data needed by other methods. Comparable results were obtained in this study with only 0.1% of labeled data. However, the concern is longer training time as AAE trains one neural network for the AE and two neural networks for Discriminators.

V. SECURITY-BASED CHALLENGES AND PROPOSED SOLUTIONS

IoT sector faces several security challenges that need to be fixed at priority for the IoT domain's further progress. The heterogeneous nature of IoT devices is a major concern as due to this issue single solution is not possible. Fig. represents a detailed analysis of various research challenges, research gaps, and possible solutions. CHALLENGE 1: ROBUST MACHINE LEARNING MODEL Broadly robustness is defined as the property where results obtained in the training set are similar to that of the test set. A robust machine learning model is required for real-world applications . SVM and LASSO algorithms can be written as robust algorithms . The models work well in theory, but all are not accepted at enterprise levels because of robustness.

PROPOSED SOLUTION: Incremental Learning can be used as a solution for achieving robustness in actual terms. As the data is changing continuously in a real-world scenario, a model might get trained on a quite different set from the actual validation set. In Incremental Learning, the model keeps learning continuously, making it more robust. Deep learning techniques like the generation of adversarial data for checking the system's robustness are being used in some works. Combining the benefits of both Incremental and Deep Learning can provide astonishing results. CHALLENGE 2: GENERALIZABILITY OF MODEL Robustness is a necessary and sufficient condition for generalizability. Generalizability is defined by assessing the performance of a model on unseen test situations . Robustness and generalizability are usually not seen together to evaluate a model, whereas a robust, generalizable model should be the target to make a sustainable model.

PROPOSED SOLUTION: Incremental and transfer Learning, if used collectively, might solve this issue. Incremental Learning is often used in image classification , target recognition , and used less in Intrusion Detection or information security. Similar is the case for transfer learning; the fusion of these two techniques can pave way for incredible results in terms of robustness and generalizability in the field of anomaly detection. CHALLENGE 3: REAL-TIME ANALYSIS Real-time analysis is essential for any model to be adopted at the enterprise level. IDS models presented in the literature are typically offline. In malware classification, the challenge is in identifying patterns to distinguish between legitimate and malware traffic. In offline mode, machine learning models work on static datasets while the online stream of data is analyzed in online Learning. Till now, real-time analysis of data is not explored much for malware analysis.

PROPOSED SOLUTION: Incremental Learning can be the solution for real-time analysis as the model can get updated according to newly added features. The significant old results can be kept aside to extract information from the same for upcoming similar data. The related approach is used by Qureshi et al. in case of support vectors, by retaining old samples which are likely to become support vector. This concept is being actively used in various use cases of Machine Learning, but it is not explored much in malware analysis. When used with Transfer Learning, Deep Learning enhances system performance multifold as better results can be obtained in less training time.

VI. CONCLUSION

The evolution of IoT has been incredible, and it has paved the way for several endeavors in the field of technology. IoT security plays a crucial role in further technology progression as investors will move ahead in this domain only when stateof-the-art security measures are met. In general, cybersecurity works on the CIA model, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The attackers tend to utilize vulnerabilities of communication protocols for launching attacks. Better mitigation techniques are required for mitigating attacks as these attacks jeopardize service providers' reputations. All three aspects, viz. confidentiality, integrity, and availability, are affected due to the attacks, which is the primary concern for service providers. IoT devices have scales for generating the data from small-scale applications with few bytes every second to Kbytes every second depending upon the application being addressed. This data is sometimes very crucial, viz. medical data, military data. Distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks are significant threats for the cyber world because of their potential to bring down the victims. DDoS attacks require a large number of devices for launching attacks, and for this, IoT devices are well suited. As in most cases, users will not understand that the device is compromised; viz., baby monitors, smart toys have a user interface with limited access and may usually work even after being part of a Botnet army. With the increasing volume of IoT devices, there is an urgent need to detect Botnet attacks timely to remove compromised devices.

As we move into the era where almost everything being used by humans will be connected to the internet, the security of these devices becomes supreme. Two major solutions are found in the literature for preventing DDoS attacks, namely Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). The Intrusion Detection System is analyzed in the undertaken review work, and various intrusion detection models have been evaluated. Furthermore, we have also discussed the classification of Intrusion Detection Systems, different anomaly detection techniques, various Intrusion Detection System models based on datasets, diverse machine learning, and deep learning techniques for data pre-processing and malware detection. In the end, a broader perspective has been envisioned while surveying different intrusion detection techniques and future visions.

In the future, we plan to implement these solutions and develop a robust and generalized intrusion detection model.

I. INTRODUCTION Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging field of collection and transfer of data without human intervention. It is referred to as a system of connected objects embedded with sensors, software, control systems. Technological advances such as machine learning have resulted in the evolution of IoT technology . IoT applications are increasingly making their presence felt in almost every area. Some of the widespread applications of IoT are shown in Fig. . In the present era, every sector is moving towards connected things to meet the world's pace. Education is not limited to the traditional way; now classrooms are connected, and with the use of The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Jiafeng Xie. technology, differently-abled students with hearing issues can learn using connected gloves and tablets. Similarly, IoT technology can turn out to be a significant boon for other disabled students. In fast-running lives, homes and cities are getting smart to fulfill humankind's basic needs such as security, waste management, air quality improvement, and entertainment . The healthcare sector has transformed with the introduction of IoT, be it wearables or telemedicine and remote monitoring of patients . IoT in agriculture has changed the way of traditional farming with better water management and soil monitoring . IoT has been a game-changer in smart vehicles by introducing connected vehicles . Also, in electric grids introduction of IoT has given energy management new heights . IoT has evolved into this big industry after This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see many advancements; the chronological advancement of IoT is depicted in Fig. . From the internet-enabled refrigerator to IoT-based smart city , the industry has come a long way, and it has become an integral part of everyday lives. IoT has marked its presence in the defense sector by introducing the Internet of Battlefields in 2017, and in the subsequent year, it was introduced in the healthcare sector. In the year 2005, the first Wi-Fi enabled rabbit was manufactured in Japan . 2011 was a milestone year for IoT as it was added in the Hype cycle of emerging technologies; later on, it has been frequent in the Hype cycle and even recently in 2017, IoT remains at the peak of hype in Gartner cycle . The focus is now shifting towards IoT security after the first large-scale IoT-based attack in 2016 . Fig. represents a variety of research challenges associated with growing IoT devices. The security protocols are not unified. Each device has a particular solution depending on the vendor. Also, as the IoT network is comprised of heterogeneous devices, protocols are not standardized. Traditional security methods do not work with IoT devices because they have a small processor, and adding security becomes impractical. Power resources and the location is also a concern for implementing security techniques. Mobility is a significant concern for connected cars, i.e., in smart automobiles . In other applications where mobility is low, achieving trust is comparatively more comfortable than in fast-moving connected vehicles. IoT devices face significant Resource Constraint challenges as there are multiple facet constraints for IoT: cost, power, size. Heterogeneity of IoT devices is another major issue as most IoT applications work in a distributed environment with sensors, actuators, and other devices . Table represents various IoT-related open Issues and research challenges. These challenges make industry players skeptical about using IoT technology. Governments have not come up with a standard framework and regulation for IoT, giving freehand to service providers for implementing IoT. This creates a challenge in coming up with a common platform for any IoT solution. Expectations are on the rise from IoT in terms of performance with technological advancements, specifically artificial intelligence and data engineering. TABLE 1. IoT research challenges. Similarly, interoperability is required as connected devices are increasing and common platforms are less for IoT. The connectivity issue is of concern as several highly critical IoT devices are involved in data transfer. Maintaining reliable data transfer for heterogeneous IoT devices poses a serious technical challenge. The security requirement is essential in the case of IoT to maintain trust among consumers. Security management takes a back seat in IoT because of cost, size, and power. This consequently makes IoT vulnerable to security attacks, ultimately causing enormous financial and reputational losses. Research Contributions: In the literature, several surveys are available; key contributions of some of the highly cited research works are represented in Table . A detailed comparison of surveys and the proposed work is also depicted in Table .

Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section VI.

II. SECURITY ISSUES IN IoT DOMAIN Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly growing in numbers, and lack of security in these devices has resulted in transforming IoT devices into a hotbed for malicious activities . Fig. represents various cybersecurity attacks that can impact IoT layers such as the Perception layer, Support layer, Network layer, and Application layer. A widely accepted four-layered design is considered in the conducted review work . PERCEPTION LAYER: The perception layer comprises sensors and actuators . Sensors sense the environment around them while actuators act as controllers to take action based on sensed data. Sensors are also known as nodes, and these are vulnerable to node capturing attacks where an attacker may either capture the node or replace it with a malicious node. The over the air update of these nodes' firmware or software gives the attacker a chance to inject malicious or false code in the node causing Malicious code injection or False data injection attacks . TABLE 3. Classification of referenced articles based on surveyed topics. Side channel attack based on laser, power consumption, and timing can occur in this layer . The nodes present in an open environment are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks at the time of data transmission or similar events . IoT devices are power constraint, and the attackers exploit this issue by draining the power source and causing Sleep deprivation. Typically, IoT devices' security process is enabled after booting, giving the attacker opportunity to launch an attack at boot time. NETWORK LAYER: The network layer sends information from the sensing layer for further processing to the computational unit. This layer is highly vulnerable to attacks comprising several IoT devices . Phishing attack targets several IoT devices in an attempt to at least take control of a few of them . In a DDoS attack, an attacker tries to overwhelm the target by sending spoofed requests. IoT devices act as botnets in DDoS attacks and can create a massive flood of requests to deny the target further access to resources . Worm-hole, Sinkhole attacks are examples of Routing attacks in which the attacker tries to route the traffic to a different path by gaining access to nodes . At the time TABLE 5. A representation of various type of DDoS attacks. SUPPORT LAYER: The Support layer acts between Network and Application layer. This layer helps in resource allocation, computing, and data storage. Security of database is essential at this layer, and it is prone to DDoS, Man-in-themiddle, SQL injection kind of attacks. A broker like MQTT protocol is used for communication between client and service provider. In a Man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker takes control of the broker, thus controlling all the communication . The target of attack in the Support layer is usually to access data; therefore, database and cloud security are crucial in this layer. APPLICATION LAYER: The application layer contains smart applications viz. smart city, smart home, healthcare, and more. This layer directly deals with end-users; hence privacy and data theft are major concerns at this layer . Similar to other layers, this layer is also affected by the Malicious code injection attack. A service interruption attack is similar to a denial of service attack as it causes service disruption. Some users are given the unique privilege to allow legitimate user access at the time of an attack, but the whole system can come under attack if this access is compromised. This makes access control attack one of the major concerns at the application layer . Sniffing attack takes place with the help of sniffing tools where attacker sniffs network traffic data, and confidential data is compromised in this attack .

A. DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICES (DDoS) ATTACKS The DDoS attack, as the name suggests, is launched to overwhelm the target and disrupt services. The DDoS attack requires a large number of devices for launching an attack, and for this, IoT devices are well suited. As in most cases, users will not understand that the device is compromised; for example, baby monitors and smart toys have a user interface with limited access. They may generally work even after being part of a Botnet army. With the increasing volume of IoT devices, there is an urgent need to detect attacks timely to remove compromised devices. IoT devices were used as Botnets by Mirai in a significant DDoS attack, and also several such attacks have taken place . Table represents a comparative analysis illustrating three categories of DDoS attacks. The severity of DDoS attacks can be understood from Fig. , which comprises major DDoS attacks from 2013 to 2020. Leading service providers like Amazon Web Services have been the victim of DDoS attacks. KrebsOnSecurity, Cloudflare, AWS, and more DDoS attack victims are themselves security providers against such attacks , . Therefore, as shown in Fig. , attacks on these major establishments hamper companies financially and impede their reputation. In a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, the attacker tries to disrupt the services of the target by utilizing its resources with the help of fake requests. Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is an amplified DoS attack. In a DDoS attack, requests are initiated from many sources, and hence it is named as distributed DoS. Due to this, it becomes challenging to mitigate DDoS attacks. There are many types of DDoS attacks: TCP SYN Flood attack, Teardrop attack, Smurf attack, Ping of Death attack, Botnets. DDoS attacks can also be classified as Reflection and Amplification attacks. In a reflection attack, the size of the request and response is the same , whereas, in an amplification attack, the size of the response is many times bigger than that of the request . In Table , the chronological evolution of DDoS attack vectors is depicted.

B. DDoS ATTACK IN IoT DEVICES DDoS and DoS attacks differ in the attack surface used to launch the attack. In a DDoS attack, multiple systems are used to launch the attack. These systems might be desktops, servers, IoT devices, and other connected devices . Gaining access to these devices is the first step to launch an attack. The attackers exploit vulnerabilities of devices for taking control. In IoT, there are several security concerns that attackers are actively abusing . Common vulnerabilities exploited by attackers for launching an attack using IoT: VOLUME 9, 2021 TABLE 6. A representation of the evolution of DDoS attack vectors.

INSECURE CONNECTION: Connected devices are used for launching attacks, and it becomes a cakewalk for the attacker to infect a device when there is no firewall at work. 2. WEAK PASSWORD: Brute force attack comes into action when passwords are weak. In IoT, especially companies tend to keep the default password same for all the devices, and if not changed by the device user, it becomes effortless for the attacker to infect the device. Due to this practice, attackers try to find out more devices from the same manufacturer after successfully infecting some of a particular manufacturer's devices. 3. FIRMWARE UPDATES: Most IoT devices remain insecure because of outdated firmware. In some cases, the firmware update is not secure, which can leave the device unprotected. 4. SOFTWARE VULNERABILITIES: Software-related vulnerabilities remain on the watch list of attackers before the manufacturer releases any patch. These vulnerabilities are TABLE 7. A detailed analysis indicating why IoT is preferred over other devices for DDoS attacks. usually exploited by skilled attackers as these are difficult to identify and exploit. 5. VULNERABILITIES IN DATA HANDLING: Data transfer is a crucial step for connected devices, and at this phase, any loophole in the connection to the cloud or server can very well be exploited by the attacker. A detailed analysis indicating the cause of preference of IoT devices over other devices is presented in Table . Conventional devices are usually secure as compared to IoT devices because of traditional security practices. This specifies the reason behind the drastic increase in IoT attack surface. For launching a DDoS attack, the attacker runs malware scripts and tries to find out vulnerable devices. This process is similar in the case of IoT and other devices. It is a bit easier for the attacker to infect IoT devices because of a lack of security . Once the attacker achieves access to these devices, unpretentious devices get mutated to bots, and the collection of these devices is called a botnet . This botnet army can further be used for launching an attack by the master, or the master can decide to sell the army of bots for the use of other malicious actors. The DDoS attack, as shown in Fig. , takes place when multiple requests are sent using a botnet army, ultimately overwhelming the victim. TABLE 8. Comparative analysis of IDS And IPS systems. All the servers are designed to handle a particular number of requests at a time, and attackers try to reach this threshold and exceed that by an enormous amount to overwhelm and ultimately deny the server to perform further . IoT devices are exploited by attackers because of software, hardware, physical vulnerabilities. Along with these vulnerabilities, IoT devices use protocols that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks, viz. CoAP, RPL, 6LoWPAN .

III. INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM As we move into the era where almost everything being used by humans will be connected to the internet, the security of these devices becomes paramount. Two major solutions are found in the literature for preventing DDoS attacks, namely Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). IDS is a precautionary measure where the system itself takes no action in case of intrusion; instead, an alarm is raised. IPS is the punitive measure where an action is taken by the system in case of intrusion . In IPS, an issue arises in the case of false positives as legitimate users can also get blocked. Table represents a detailed comparative analysis of IDS and IPS systems. Further in this study, IDS is focused upon as false alarm rate is a significant concern in malware classification. Also, punitive action taken on legitimate users can ruin the whole reason for creating a detection system. Fig. represents a graphical representation of the category of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Based on the target location, it can be classified as Host-based, Network-based, or Hybrid IDS. Host-based IDS is specific to a system, detection of an inside intruder is strong, and it can very well assess the extent of the compromise, but it is expensive as one IDS is required per host . In Network-based IDS, the outside intrusion is very well detected, and it can protect all hosts, but there is too much traffic to analyze . Hybrid IDS is flexible and provides more security as it combines features of both Host-based and Network-based IDS . In Active IDS, definite action is taken for certain alerts, whereas only reports are generated, or alarms are raised in Passive IDS. Centralized IDS use individual monitors for monitoring each host, as it does not scale according to requirement, thus providing less flexibility. Moreover, centralized IDS is prone to a single point of failure. Distributed IDS, on the other hand, works as a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, and in this case, each monitoring unit doubles up as an analysis unit as well.

A. ANOMALY DETECTION TECHNIQUES Two major approaches being used for Malware Detection are Signature-based Detection and Anomaly-based Detection. The signature-based detection technique is not reasonably successful in the case of Botnets as Botnets keep on mutating, and as a result, Bot signature also keeps on changing. These techniques are not useful in real-world situations when the target is to detect new variants of Botnets. Anomaly-based detection techniques , on the other hand, are quite popular, as these techniques presume that Botnet traffic will be behaviorally different from normal traffic. There are some other approaches, like Community Base Anomaly Detection , where Bots are identified using Communication Graph; for this to work accurately, a full graph should be available. Particular protocols/structures are also used for detection in a research study, but this approach is not practical if the same structure is not operated by other Botnets . Bad Neighborhood is also one of the methods used in Spam and Phishing Detection; it is defined as a cluster of IP addresses that perform malicious activities over a certain period. Moura et al. used this approach for IPv4 attacks and generated a blacklist of IPs. This approach is not entirely practical as DDoS attacks are widespread, and it is challenging to assign clusters for blacklisting. Another method is whitelisting IPs, as Yoon , where a VIP list is created assuming that VIPs will log in from a particular IP address, i.e., IP address not very dynamic for personal laptops. This way, critical people can still use the websites which are under DDoS attack. This approach is also not very useful as it may only benefit a small set of people. Several Anomaly detection techniques are present in the literature. Table represents a detailed comparative analysis of different Anomaly detection techniques. As seen from the Table, the machine learning-based approach is advantageous and is accepted globally for a wide range of malware classification. Therefore, the undertaken study focuses on the machine learning-based approach. FIGURE 10. Confusion matrix.

B. PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR IDS Some of the predominantly used performance metrics for Intrusion Detection Systems are discussed below.

1) CONFUSION MATRIX Confusion Matrix (CM) is not directly a performance measure in itself. Still, it is one of the most instinctive metrics for defining a classification model's correctness. Almost all performance metrics are computed using CM parameters. In Confusion Matrix, there are two ways to reduce errors: reducing False Negatives and reducing False Positives. There is no set rule for the same, and it depends on the requirement. For instance, for email spam classification, False Positives should be minimized, and for cancer patient classification, false negatives should be minimized.

2) ACCURACY Accuracy is defined as the number of correct predictions over total predictions. This metric is ideal for use in the case of a balanced dataset. When there is a majority class in a dataset, the results provided by this metric may not reflect the model's actual performance. 3) PRECISION Precision is a measure to calculate the Machine Learning Model's accuracy in finding the number of actual positives out of total predicted positives. This metric is useful when False Positive is of high cost for Model quality, for example, email Spam Detection Model.

4) RECALL/SENSITIVITY Recall is a measure to calculate the Machine Learning Model's accuracy in finding the number of positives out of total actual positives. This metrics is useful when False Negative is of high cost for Model quality, for example, Fraud Detection Model.

5) F-1 SCORE It is calculated as a Harmonic Mean of precision and recall metrics to better evaluate model performance. This is a metric of importance for an imbalanced dataset as in this; equal importance is given to both Precision and Recall. TABLE 9. Comparative analysis of anomaly detection techniques. 7) AUC-ROC CURVE Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a measure to determine the stability between precision and recall by a varying threshold. The Area Under Curve (AUC) represents the quality of the classification model. True Positive Rate (TPR) = TP TP + FN . . . (6) False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP FP + TN . . . It is a curve between TPR, i.e., Recall (Sensitivity), and FPR, i.e., (1 -Specificity). In general, AUC near to one represents a better classification model. Several other metrics are also used in the performance evaluation of IDS, namely the KAPPA metric, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and many more, depending on the requirement.

IV. REVIEW OF STEPS INVOLVED IN IDS A. REVIEW OF VARIOUS DATASETS IN IDS Data can be collected in two ways in IDS: first by using existing datasets else by creating own dataset. There are several datasets being extensively used for Anomaly Detection. KDD-99 is one of the oldest and extensive dataset, and despite it being highly imbalanced, it is used even now due to the lack of its alternatives. NSL-KDD was created to remove the issues associated with KDD-99. It is one of the benchmark datasets used for Anomaly detections regardless of whether it is obsolete, as the attacks incorporated in this dataset are mostly outdated. The skewedness of KDD-99 and NSL-KDD is almost removed in UNSW-NB15 , , consisting of 49 features and 10 target classes, whereas KDD consists of 41 features and 5 target classes. For Botnets, CTU-13 having 13 scenarios; each of different Botnet samples is being used nowadays. A separate malware is executed for each capture, which performs different actions using different protocols. ISOT is also one of the popular datasets , particularly for IoT Botnet attack databases. A detailed review of some of the popular existing network-based datasets is represented in Table . There are some tools and techniques available for creating own dataset in the literature. Wireshark is used to capture and present network traffic. Detection rates achieved are high as DoS tools produce quite predictable traffic. Spleen is a software tool for creating a dataset similar to DARPA . In this application, some additional features can also be added for better functionality. CICFlowmeter is a java based tool used for extracting network features from raw network captures. It captures a set of 80 features and prepares a pcap or CSV file to be used for further analysis. Sharafaldin et al. created two networks: 1.) Victim-Network consisting of 3 servers,1 firewall, 2 switches, and 10 PCs, 2.) Attack-Network includes one router, one switch, and four PCs. This kind of network is generally used for data generation. Dataset generated in this work contains attacks based on McAfee report 2016. This dataset's shortcoming is the number of systems used is less, and it needs to be updated for more recent attacks, and more Botnet attack data should be used. Commercial IoT devices were infected in the lab using Mirai and Bashlite Botnets by Meidan et al. to launch an attack. The network is sniffed using port mirroring on the central switch, and data is recorded using Wireshark. Djanie et al. used eight DoS attack tools for launching an attack on a Virtual Ubuntu 19 Machine. For identifying a suitable dataset for research work, the number of records plays a crucial role. Fig. depicts the bar chart representation of the number of attack records in Percentage. As shown in Fig. , some of the datasets like KDD-99 consist of many attack records, i.e., .14% in the training set and 80.52% in the test Whereas some of the datasets like CDX 2009 consists of smaller number of attack records, i.e., 0.76%. B. REVIEW OF VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN IDS Data pre-processing comprises several steps: adding missing values, normalizing data, removing unwanted features/outliers. Feature analysis and extraction is the backbone of any Machine Learning Model. For feature extraction, different optimization techniques are used by researchers: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Boosting Algorithms. Machine learning techniques are mainly used for feature engineering as they are lightweight and less complicated . Botnet analysis has two major subdivisions, specifically Flow-based traffic analysis and Graph-based traffic analysis . These analyses differ mainly on the feature selection part as statistical features are selected for Flow-based analysis; otherwise, Graph-based features are chosen. Usually, the same set of features are extracted for different time windows to create a real-time scenario . These are statistical features and can be highly useful for capturing malicious activities as features indicate anomaly if the behavior is unseen, which happens in the case of a spoofed IP address. A botnet can be Detected using Graph-based features, as done by Chowdhury et al. . In this detection, efficiency was improved by removing inactive nodes, and detection methodology was given, where, by using only six nodes, Bots can be detected effectively. Features are selected by Ghasemi et al. using a genetic algorithm. For each class, a two labeled dataset is created, which is then given to classifiers, and after applying the voting mechanism best classifier is predicted, and a new dataset is created where number of classes is equal to the number of columns. This dataset is further used for the training model; this way model will be trained for different behaviors of all classes. Some of the critical data pre-processing techniques based on machine learning are discussed in Table . In Intrusion Detection System, classification and clustering algorithms are used extensively. On network traffic, data classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) , , Decision Tree , , KNN have given important and powerful results. Incremental Learning is one of the recent techniques being used with machine learning techniques for real-time results. It is often used in image classification , target recognition , and used less in Intrusion Detection or information security. SVM is one of the most prevalent techniques being used in Incremental Learning. An incremental SVM Learning algorithm based on Incremental Clustering for Intrusion Detection is proposed by Du et al. . Yi et al. used a kernel function modified for incorporating Mean and Mean Square TABLE 10. A detailed review of various network-based datasets. Value of attributes to develop an upgraded Incremental SVM algorithm, which solves the oscillation problem of follow-up learning process of Incremental Incremental Learning is used by Zhuang et al. for proposing a Malware Detection algorithm to preserve support vectors obtained from old data of SVM. Intrusion Detection is done using Incremental Multiclass SVM by Li et al. . Although using Incremental Learning is required for real-time detection, here small dataset is used, so the sample size used for classification is significantly less, and SVM performance is not suitable for such scenarios. Online and Real-time version of unsupervised network anomaly detector is introduced using Incremental Grid Clustering for Intrusion Detection by Dromard et al. . Results in the study demonstrate the scalability of the algorithm and can be used online. It uses a time sliding window, which is discrete for traffic collection. Speed is a bit slow, which can be improved using a better streaming tool. A synthetically generated log file is used; the applied algorithm learns by itself, creating clusters in sliding time as presented by Landauer et al. . In this, false positives were detected in large amounts, which remains a big problem in Real-Time Anomaly Detection. Yang et al. extracted features using damped Incremental statistics in place of a commonly used time sliding window, which reduced memory consumption. Incremental Possibilistic clustering (IPC) is used to detect outliers as new centers for clusters and use Mahalanobis distance for merging clusters. Various Genetic algorithms are used for anomaly detection. There is a recent shift of focus on swarm intelligence, which is used for optimization. For optimizing hyperparameters, different techniques are used by researchers. Shorman et al. achieved impressive results using Grey Wolf Optimization for tuning the hyperparameters of one-class support vector Machine (OCSVM) and selecting the best Botnet features. Table 12 represents a detailed TABLE 11. A detailed review of various machine learning-based data pre-processing techniques. review of significant machine learning-based malware detection techniques.

C. REVIEW OF VARIOUS DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN IDS Deep learning techniques are being extensively used for feature engineering because of their ability to learn high-dimensional features. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is one of the most common feature engineering techniques, specifically for their application in synthetic data creation and learning better about minority classes. Ferdowsi et al. used GAN for feature engineering as well as detection. In this study, a distributed GAN is proposed to provide a fully distributed IDS for the IoT to detect anomalous behavior without reliance on any centralized controller. Learning more about the characteristics of the minority class seems to have improved the performance of classifying normal classes since the characteristics are significantly different from those of other classes, as depicted by Lee et al. by deploying GAN for feature engineering. Features engineering is achieved using the Flow Wasserstein GAN model and Attention GRU Model by Han et al. . An attention model is used to detect the payload-based attack. Yang et al. used a Supervised adversarial Variational autoencoder for feature engineering. Regularization is achieved using Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty. The advantage of SAVAER DNN is that it can effectively detect lower frequent attacks along with frequent attacks. Taylor Series is used along with Elephant Herd Optimization (TEHO) to train Deep Belief Network . Deep networks' training time issue is resolved in this study by using Bhattacharya Distance for feature classification. Jiang et al. addressed the issue of Data imbalance by TABLE 12. A detailed review of various machine learning-based Malware detection techniques. using One-Side Selection (OSS) to reduce noise in majority classes and synthetically enhancing minority classes with the help of the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling (SMOTE) technique. In this study, CNN is used for extracting spatial features, and BiLSTM for extracting temporal features. Simple feedforward neural networks are used as weak learners for feature engineering by Nabil et al. . Binary classification is achieved in this study, and neural networks are used as specialized networks for a subset of features. Table represents a detailed review of the critical Deep Learning based data pre-processing techniques. Supervised Learning based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is used by Martin et al. . A new algorithm is used, which can also be applied in Online Learning. The response is very fast in DRL. Four DRL techniques, namely DQN, DDQN, Policy gradient, and Actor critic, are used in this work. Out of these, DDQN gives the best results. The results are also compared with existing Machine Learning algorithms. Sparse Autoencoder and Outlier detection method is used. This method can forecast IoT Botnets in advance, making it easier to detect and mitigate the attack, as shown by Kumar and Bhama . Restricted Boltzmann Machine is used by Otoum et al. for feature engineering and detection. The study indicates that RBC IDS and adaptively supervised and clustered hybrid IDS achieve the same detection and accuracy rates. However, the detection time of RBC IDS is approximately twice that of ASCH IDS. Wei et al. used Deep Belief Network for feature engineering and Deep Belief Network and Particle Swarm Optimization for detection. In this study, an optimal network VOLUME 9, 2021 TABLE 13. A detailed review of various deep learning-based data pre-processing techniques. structure is acquired by comparing the DBN structure obtained five optimization algorithms. et al. normalized features manually and used RNN as a classifier. The detection rate achieved for DoS and Probing attacks was higher as compared to R2L and U2R attacks. This due to the property of RNN of working well with time-series tasks, and DoS and Probing attacks have more obvious timing characteristics than R2L and U2R attacks. LSTM and Autoencoder classifiers are used as an ensemble by Zhong et al. . This heterogeneous ensemble learning ensured that the model has better adaptability and accuracy when compared with other methods. The study by Muhuri et al. shows that the performance of the LSTM-RNN model is better in binary classification as compared to multiclass classification. In binary classification, the proposed model outperforms SVM and RF models. In multiclass Classification, RF outperforms the LSTM-RNN model, as minority attack types do not show obvious timing characteristics. A study done by Hsu et al. shows that after applying CNN, accuracy increases considerably when compared with only LSTM model. Some of the noteworthy Deep Learning based detection techniques are depicted in Table . Parra et al. proposed a model working on two security mechanisms simultaneously. A distributed convolutional neural network is used to secure IoT devices at the origin of attack. At the back-end, the LSTM model is used. Using two models in tandem reduces the resource and communication requirement. Lee et al. compared LSTM, CNN, MLP, Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) for detecting attacks based on packet length in SDN switch. Results show that MLP performs best. The reason might be the choice of number of layers as in this work for LSTM, only one layer is used, and three layers were used for all others. The results obtained vary accordingly. Bots are utilized to send traffic to the victim at comparatively lower speed in link-flooding attacks. These attacks are defended by Chen et al. using an ensemble of CNN and LSTM models. The link-flooding DDoS attacks are difficult to mitigate; LSTM is utilized in this work to review the attack patterns periodically. For a similar low rate DDoS attack pattern in wireless systems, Liu and Yin used a combination of LSTM and CGAN. This is because LSTM works well in identifying patterns in sequenced packages. The study by Zavrak and Iskefiyeli shows that Variational Autoencoder gave similar ROC curves for the attacks displaying similar behavioral characteristics. Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) was used by Hara and Shiomoto as a semi-supervised learning technique to address the issue of more extensive labeled data needed by other methods. Comparable results were obtained in this study with only 0.1% of labeled data. However, the concern is longer training time as AAE trains one neural network for the AE and two neural networks for Discriminators.

V. SECURITY-BASED CHALLENGES AND PROPOSED SOLUTIONS IoT sector faces several security challenges that need to be fixed at priority for the IoT domain's further progress. The heterogeneous nature of IoT devices is a major concern as due to this issue single solution is not possible. Fig. represents a detailed analysis of various research challenges, research gaps, and possible solutions. CHALLENGE 1: ROBUST MACHINE LEARNING MODEL Broadly robustness is defined as the property where results obtained in the training set are similar to that of the test set. A robust machine learning model is required for real-world applications . SVM and LASSO algorithms can be written as robust algorithms . The models work well in theory, but all are not accepted at enterprise levels because of robustness. PROPOSED SOLUTION: Incremental Learning can be used as a solution for achieving robustness in actual terms. As the data is changing continuously in a real-world scenario, a model might get trained on a quite different set from the actual validation set. In Incremental Learning, the model keeps learning continuously, making it more robust. Deep learning techniques like the generation of adversarial data for checking the system's robustness are being used in some works. Combining the benefits of both Incremental and Deep Learning can provide astonishing results. CHALLENGE 2: GENERALIZABILITY OF MODEL Robustness is a necessary and sufficient condition for generalizability. Generalizability is defined by assessing the performance of a model on unseen test situations . Robustness and generalizability are usually not seen together to evaluate a model, whereas a robust, generalizable model should be the target to make a sustainable model. PROPOSED SOLUTION: Incremental and transfer Learning, if used collectively, might solve this issue. Incremental Learning is often used in image classification , target recognition , and used less in Intrusion Detection or information security. Similar is the case for transfer learning; the fusion of these two techniques can pave way for incredible results in terms of robustness and generalizability in the field of anomaly detection. CHALLENGE 3: REAL-TIME ANALYSIS Real-time analysis is essential for any model to be adopted at the enterprise level. IDS models presented in the literature are typically offline. In malware classification, the challenge is in identifying patterns to distinguish between legitimate and malware traffic. In offline mode, machine learning models work on static datasets while the online stream of data is analyzed in online Learning. Till now, real-time analysis of data is not explored much for malware analysis. PROPOSED SOLUTION: Incremental Learning can be the solution for real-time analysis as the model can get updated according to newly added features. The significant old results can be kept aside to extract information from the same for upcoming similar data. The related approach is used by Qureshi et al. in case of support vectors, by retaining old samples which are likely to become support vector. This concept is being actively used in various use cases of Machine Learning, but it is not explored much in malware analysis. When used with Transfer Learning, Deep Learning enhances system performance multifold as better results can be obtained in less training time.

VI. CONCLUSION The evolution of IoT has been incredible, and it has paved the way for several endeavors in the field of technology. IoT security plays a crucial role in further technology progression as investors will move ahead in this domain only when stateof-the-art security measures are met. In general, cybersecurity works on the CIA model, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The attackers tend to utilize vulnerabilities of communication protocols for launching attacks. Better mitigation techniques are required for mitigating attacks as these attacks jeopardize service providers' reputations. All three aspects, viz. confidentiality, integrity, and availability, are affected due to the attacks, which is the primary concern for service providers. IoT devices have scales for generating the data from small-scale applications with few bytes every second to Kbytes every second depending upon the application being addressed. This data is sometimes very crucial, viz. medical data, military data. Distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks are significant threats for the cyber world because of their potential to bring down the victims. DDoS attacks require a large number of devices for launching attacks, and for this, IoT devices are well suited. As in most cases, users will not understand that the device is compromised; viz., baby monitors, smart toys have a user interface with limited access and may usually work even after being part of a Botnet army. With the increasing volume of IoT devices, there is an urgent need to detect Botnet attacks timely to remove compromised devices. As we move into the era where almost everything being used by humans will be connected to the internet, the security of these devices becomes supreme. Two major solutions are found in the literature for preventing DDoS attacks, namely Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). The Intrusion Detection System is analyzed in the undertaken review work, and various intrusion detection models have been evaluated. Furthermore, we have also discussed the classification of Intrusion Detection Systems, different anomaly detection techniques, various Intrusion Detection System models based on datasets, diverse machine learning, and deep learning techniques for data pre-processing and malware detection. In the end, a broader perspective has been envisioned while surveying different intrusion detection techniques and future visions. In the future, we plan to implement these solutions and develop a robust and generalized intrusion detection model.
