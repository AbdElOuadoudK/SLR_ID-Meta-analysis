To address the identified cybersecurity challenges, several policy recommendations are proposed. First, there is a need for the development and enforcement of comprehensive cybersecurity standards and regulations specifically tailored to smart grid technologies. These standards should encourage the adoption of best practices in cybersecurity, including regular security assessments and the implementation of layered security architectures. Additionally, policies should promote the sharing of cybersecurity threat intelligence among stakeholders within the energy sector to enhance collective defense mechanisms. Finally, investment in cybersecurity research and development should be prioritized to ensure that security measures keep pace with the evolving threat landscape. Finally, while smart grid technologies offer promising avenues for achieving sustainable energy goals, they also introduce significant cybersecurity challenges that must be addressed. Future research should focus on developing innovative security solutions that can adapt to the dynamic nature of cyber threats. This includes exploring the potential of emerging technologies, assessing the cybersecurity implications of integrating renewable energy sources, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness among all stakeholders. Moreover, interdisciplinary research that bridges the gap between technical cybersecurity solutions and policy-making can contribute to the development of a more secure and sustainable energy infrastructure.
