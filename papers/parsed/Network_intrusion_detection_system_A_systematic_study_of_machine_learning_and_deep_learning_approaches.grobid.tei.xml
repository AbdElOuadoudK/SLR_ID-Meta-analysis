<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The rapid advances in the internet and communication fields have resulted in a huge increase in the network size and the corresponding data. As a result, many novel attacks are being generated and have posed challenges for network security to accurately detect intrusions. Furthermore, the presence of the intruders with the aim to launch various attacks within the network cannot be ignored. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one such tool that prevents the network from possible intrusions by inspecting the network traffic, to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Despite enormous efforts by the researchers, IDS still faces challenges in improving detection accuracy while reducing false alarm rates and in detecting novel intrusions. Recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based IDS systems are being deployed as potential solutions to detect intrusions across the network in an efficient manner. This article first clarifies the concept of IDS and then provides the taxonomy based on the notable ML and DL techniques adopted in designing network-based IDS (NIDS) systems. A comprehensive review of the recent NIDS-based articles is provided by discussing the strengths and limitations of the proposed solutions. Then, recent trends and advancements of ML and DL-based NIDS are provided in terms of the proposed methodology, evaluation metrics, and dataset selection. Using the shortcomings of the proposed methods, we highlighted various research challenges and provided the future scope for the research in improving ML and DL-based NIDS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>With the recent interest and progress in the development of internet and communication technologies over the last decade, network security has emerged as a vital research domain. It employs tools like firewall, antivirus software, and intrusion detection system (IDS) to ensure the security of the network and all its associated assets within a cyberspace. 1 Among these, network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) is the attack detection mechanism that provides the desired security by constantly monitoring the network traffic for malicious and suspicious behavior. <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">3</ref> The idea of IDS was first proposed by Jim Anderson in 1980. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">4</ref> Since then, many IDS products were developed and matured to satisfy the needs of network security. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">5</ref> However, the immense evolution in the technologies over the last decade has resulted in a large expansion in the network size, and the number of applications handled by the network nodes. As a result, a huge amount of important data is being generated and shared across different network nodes. The security of these data and network nodes has become a challenging task due to the generation of a large number of new attacks either through the mutation of an old attack or a novel attack. Almost every node within a network is vulnerable to security threats. For instance, the data node may be very important for an organization. Any compromise to the node's information may cause a huge impact on that organization in terms of its market reputation and financial losses. Existing IDSs have shown inefficiency in detecting various attacks including zero-day attacks and reducing the false alarm rates (FAR). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">6</ref> This eventually results in a demand for an efficient, accurate, and cost-effective NIDS to provide strong security to the network.</p><p>To fulfill the requirements of an effective IDS, the researchers have explored the possibility of using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Both ML and DL come under the big umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) and aim at learning useful information from the big data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">7</ref> These techniques have gained enormous popularity in the field of network security, over the last decade due to the invention of very powerful graphics processor units (GPUs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">8</ref> Both ML and DL are powerful tools in learning useful features from the network traffic and predicting the normal and abnormal activities based on the learned patterns. The ML-based IDS depends heavily on feature engineering to learn useful information from the network traffic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">9</ref> While DL-based IDS do not rely on feature engineering and are good at automatically learning complex features from the raw data due to its deep structure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">10</ref> Over the last decade, various ML-and DL-based solutions were proposed by the researchers to make NIDS efficient in detecting malicious attacks. However, the massive increase in the network traffic and the resulting security threats has posed many challenges for the NIDS systems to detect malicious intrusions efficiently. The research on using the DL methods for NIDS is currently in its early stage and there is still an enormous room to explore this technology within NIDS to efficiently detect intruders within the network. The purpose of this research paper is to provide a broad overview of the recent trends and advancements in ML-and DL-based solutions for NIDSs. The key idea is to furnish up-to-date information on recent ML-and DL-based NIDS to provide a baseline for the new researchers who want to start exploring this important domain. The main contributions of this article are 3-fold. (i) We conducted a systematic study to select recent journal articles focusing on various ML-and DL-based NIDS which are published during the last 3 years (2017-April 2020). (ii) We reviewed each article extensively and discussed its various features such as its proposed methodology, strength, weakness, evaluation metrics, and the used datasets. (iii) Based on these observations, we provided the recent trends of using AI methods for NIDS then highlighted various challenges in ML-/DL-based NIDs and we provided different future directions in this important domain.</p><p>There are many survey papers in the literature that provide some implementation details on the IDS. Our article is different from the other review articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref> from three aspects: (i) We followed a systematic article selection process to obtain more focused articles on NIDS design considering AI tools. While the other studies reviewed the general IDS system without using the systematic approach. (ii) Our study reviewed the articles published between 2017 and April 2020. So it provides more updated information and the recent trends followed in the design of AI-based NIDS. (iii) In our study, an extensive review of the recent NIDS based on ML and DL approach is provided where they are critically analyzed according to their methods, techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The focus is to provide researchers with more updated knowledge on AI-based NIDS in one place, where they can find the recent trends and potential research areas in the domain to start exploring it. A detailed comparison of this article with other review articles is provided in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the research methodology adopted in this study. Section 3 provides the basic IDS concept and classification methods. Section 4 elaborates the DL and ML methodologies adopted. The details about the evaluation metrics and the benchmark public datasets is illustrated in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively. Observations, recent trends in NIDS design, research challenges, and the future research scope are provided in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes this review article. The abbreviations used in this article are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. article is to answer the following questions: (i) What are the recent trends in the design of AI-based NIDS? (ii) What are the recent ML and DL methodologies adopted for NIDS design? (iii) What are the merits and demerits of each adopted methodology? (iv) Which datasets are recently used for the AI-based NIDS testing purposes? (v) What are the most frequent performance metrics used for evaluation purposes? and (vi) What is the future scope of research in AI-powered NIDS?</p><p>In phase-1, firstly search engines and keywords are identified for article search. A Scopus document search <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">18</ref> is chosen as a potential search engine due to its ability to search from almost all the well-known databases. We executed a search QUERY using an initial keyword "intrusion detection system" and adjusted the filter to show journal articles published between 2017 and 2020. The initial search QUERY resulted in the articles that proposed the IDS using different approaches like AI-based, watchdog-based, trust-based and game theoretic-based, etc. for different domain areas including wireless sensor network (WSN), internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, etc. We then redefined our keyword as intrusion detection system, network anomaly detection, and signature-based network intrusion detectionwith the combination of machine learning or deep learning to obtain more relevant articles. As a result of phase-1, relevant articles based on the keywords were selected and stored as an initial list. The detailed steps used in phase-1 to obtain an initial list are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>In phase-2, we started with the initial list and defined certain criteria to obtain articles that are more focused for review. We selected those articles which were written in the English language and proposed a new AI-based idea. We did not consider the review and survey articles. Based on these criteria, we were able to identify articles for this review, stored them in the final list, and then used them for the analysis purposes. Each selected article is analyzed based on the proposed ML-or DL-based methodology and the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology. We also analyzed the most frequent used datasets and evaluation metrics used for testing and evaluation purposes. Finally, we identify the future scope of research and challenges in the design of an efficient AI-based NIDS. The detailed process used in phase-2 for the selection of articles in the final list for review articles is summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">IDS: CONCEPT AND CLASSIFICATION</head><p>This section first explains the concept of IDS and then provides the details about the classification of IDS based on its deployment and the detection methodology. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Concept</head><p>An IDS is the combination of two words "intrusion" and "detection system." Intrusion refers to an unauthorized access to the information within a computer or network systems to compromise its integrity, confidentiality, or availability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">20</ref> While detection system is a security mechanism for the detection of such illegal activity. So, IDS is a security tool that constantly monitors the host and network traffic to detect any suspicious behavior that violates the security policy and compromises its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">21</ref> The IDS will generate alerts about detected malicious behavior to the host or network administrators. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> depicts a passive deployment of NIDS, where it is connected to a network switch configured with the port mirroring technology. The task is to mirror all the incoming and outgoing network traffic to NIDS for performing traffic monitoring to detect intrusions. NIDS can also be deployed in between the firewall and the network switch to allow all the traffic to pass through NIDS. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Classification of IDS</head><p>IDS can be classified with the perspective of its deployment or detection methods. A classification taxonomy is given in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Deployment method based IDS</head><p>From the deployment-based IDS perspective, IDS is further subclassified as host-based-IDS (HIDS) or NIDS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">22</ref> HIDS is deployed on the single information host. Its task is to monitor all the activities on this single host and scans for its security</p><p>Detection Method based IDS Deployment Method based IDS Host based IDS Network based IDS Signature based IDS Anomaly Detection based IDS Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Machine Learning / Deep Learning Models F I G U R E 4 Intrusion detection system classification taxonomy</p><p>policy violations and suspicious activities. The main drawback is its deployment on all the hosts that require intrusion protection, which results in extra-processing overhead for each node and ultimately degrades the performance of the IDS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">24</ref> In contrast, NIDS is deployed on the network with the aim to protect all devices and the entire network from intrusions. The NIDS will constantly monitor the network traffic and scans for potential security breaches and violations. This article focuses on the different methods used in the NIDS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Detection method based IDS</head><p>From the detection IDS perspective, the IDS is further subdivided into "Signature-based intrusion detection (SIDS)" and "Anomaly detection-based intrusion detection (AIDS)". SIDS, also known as the "misuse intrusion detection" or "knowledge-based intrusion detection," is based on the idea of defining a signature for attack patterns. These signatures are stored in the signature database and the data patterns are matched with these stored signatures for attack detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">26</ref> The advantage includes the high detection efficiency for the known attacks due to the availability of signature for those attacks. On the other hand, this method lacks the ability to detect the novel and new attacks due to the absence of signature patterns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">23</ref> Also, a huge signature database is maintained and compared with the data packets for possible intrusions, which makes it a resource-consuming approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">27</ref> AIDS, also called the "behavior-based IDS," is based on the idea of clearly defining a profile for normal activity. Any deviation from this normal profile will be considered as an anomaly or abnormal behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">29</ref> The major advantages of AIDS are its ability to detect unknown and new attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">30</ref> and the customized nature of the normal activity profile for different networks and applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">31</ref> However, the main drawback is the high FAR as it is difficult to find the boundary between the normal and abnormal profiles for intrusion detection. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> The popularity of the IoT paradigm due to network technologies advancement has resulted in exponential growth in the use of IoT devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">34</ref> One of the vital technology used in the development of an IoT network is the WSN, which comprises of a collection of sensor nodes for information collection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">35</ref> A huge amount of critical information is collected by these IoT sensor devices and is shared over the internet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">36</ref> This big data along with the complex structure of WSN comprising of the resource-limited sensor nodes causes security challenges for the IoT network. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">38</ref> To this end, IDS is considered as one of the effective mechanism for the security of IoT and WSN. Many different IDS approaches are proposed in the literature, which are based on the efficient use of watchdogs, trust models, and game-theoretic concepts. Watchdogs are the network nodes that are assigned the task of watching and monitoring the neighboring nodes' network traffic. Then a decision is made regarding the misbehaving nodes by using some set of rules. Many solutions are proposed for the anomaly and intrusion detection using watchdogs in the domain of WSN, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">39</ref> AdHoc networks, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">40</ref> and IoT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">41</ref> Trust models are another tool used to improve the performance of an IDS. An IDS based on the trust model evaluates the trustworthiness of their nodes to identify the malicious nodes by constantly mentoring the network traffic for abnormal behaviors. Different implementations of the IDS using trust models are based on watchdog, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">42</ref> Bayesian trust model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">43</ref> and game theory-based trust model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">45</ref> In the context of IoT, a trust management scheme can be used in a distributed manner to reduce the computational overheads of resource-constrained sensor nodes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">47</ref> Similarly, game theory is widely used for the efficient designing of IDS. It is an applied mathematical concept used to model the strategic interactions among the players by describing a game. Each game includes the set of players and each player has a set of strategies along with an action plan and payoff for each action within a game. The solution of the game is based on an equilibrium state which is based on the player's strategy to maximize the payoff. A game can be cooperative or noncooperative depending upon entities' interaction cooperatively or competitively. From the perspective of IDS for IoT and WSN, a game is modeled between the attackers and the defenders either by their interaction or by using the prediction strategy of an attacker. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref> In this article, we have focused on reviewing the AI-based NIDS, which can be deployed for the security of an IoT network by monitoring the network traffic entered through the edge router. The most common AI-based algorithms used in the design of an efficient NIDS over the past three years are briefly explained in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">AI METHODS FOR NIDS</head><p>This section provides a general methodology of the AI-based NIDS along with the details of the most commonly used ML and DL algorithms used to design an efficient NIDS. Both ML and DL are broadly classified as supervised and unsupervised algorithms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">51</ref> In supervised algorithms, the useful information is extracted from the labeled data. While unsupervised algorithms rely on the unlabeled data to extract useful features and information. 52</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">A general AI-based NIDS methodology</head><p>A NIDS developed using ML and DL methods usually involves following three major steps as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, that is, (i) Data preprocessing phase, (ii) Training phase, and (iii) Testing phase. For all the proposed solutions, the dataset is first preprocessed to transform it into the format suitable to be used by the algorithm. This stage typically involves encoding and normalization. Sometimes, the dataset requires cleaning in terms of removing entries with missing data and duplicate entries, which is also performed during this phase. The presprocessed data is then divided randomly into two portions, the training dataset, and the testing dataset. Typically, the training dataset comprises almost 80% of the original dataset size and the remaining 20% forms testing dataset. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">54</ref> The ML or DL algorithm is then trained using the training dataset in the training phase. The time taken by the algorithm in learning depends upon the size of the dataset and the complexity of the proposed model. Normally, the training time for the DL models requires more training time due to its deep and complex structure. Once the model is trained, it is tested using the testing dataset and evaluated based on the predictions it made. In the case of NIDS models, the network traffic instance will be predicted to belong to either benign (normal) or attack class.</p><p>In the following section, we provide an extensive overview of widely used ML and DL algorithms for NIDS systems.

K-Mean clustering is one of the popular centroid-based iterative ML algorithm that learns in an unsupervised manner. K represents the number of centroids (center of the cluster) within a dataset.

These nodes are organized in an input layer, many hidden layers, and an output layer. The backpropagation algorithm is used as a learning technique for the ANN. The main advantage of using an ANN technique is its ability to perform nonlinear modeling by learning from larger datasets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">73</ref> However, the main issue with training the ANN model is the high time consumption due to its complex nature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">74</ref> which slows down the learning process and to reach a suboptimal solution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">75</ref> To overcome the limitations of ANN, Huang et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">76</ref> proposed a new ANN called an extreme learning machine (ELM).

In the initial unsupervised stage, two AEs were trained separately using Normal and Attack flows to reconstruct the samples again. In the supervised stage, these new reconstructed samples are used to build a new augmented dataset that is used as input to a 1D-CNN. Then the output of this convolution layer is flattened and fed to fully connected layers, and lastly, a softmax layer classifies the dataset. Experiments were performed on the KDD Cup'99, UNSWNB15, and CICIDS2017 datasets and the proposed methodology achieves superior performance comparing different DL models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">OBSERVATIONS, CHALLENGES, AND FUTURE TRENDS</head><p>This section first discusses recent trends in IDS based on proposed methodology, performance criteria, and the dataset adopted. It also highlights the possible research gap and challenges and finally presents the future trends for the researchers to come up with an efficient, robust, and accurate IDS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Recent trends and observations</head><p>The efficiency of the AI-powered NIDS highly depends upon training using a suitable dataset. For ML models, the algorithm can be trained using a small dataset to achieve better results. But in case of the larger dataset, then ML is not suitable unless the dataset is labeled in nature. Since labeling is an expensive and time consuming process, DL methods are preferred for larger datasets. These methods will learn and extract useful patterns from raw datasets. To make NIDS efficient in detecting zero-day attacks, it needs to be trained regularly with the new data obtained as a result of monitoring the network traffic. The large dataset and deep nature of the DL algorithms will make the learning process more resource hungry in terms of computational resources and time consumption. The more the NIDS model is trained, the more efficiently it will detect intrusions. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the reviewed articles. It is observed that DL-based NIDS methodologies are preferred nowadays over the ML methodologies due to their efficiency in learning from large datasets in raw form. Since the DL algorithms require extensive computational resources, the advent of GPUs and cloud-based platforms have eased the way for the implementation of DL-based methods. We observed that in most of the proposed solutions, models are tested using older datasets such as KDD Cup'99 and NSL-KDD. We also observed that in some proposed solutions, the performance of the model showing extremely excellent results for older datasets is decreased for newer and recently proposed datasets, for <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">103</ref> Another major drawback exhibited by most of the methodologies is their inefficiency in detecting the attack having fewer samples for the training dataset. This class imbalance problem affects the detection rate and accuracy for these minority attack classes which needs further attention. Also, we observed that some of the methodologies are quite complex and it ultimately requires more model training time. We observe a trade-off between model complexity and the deep structure of DL methods. The deeper the algorithm is, the more complex the model will be and hence it will consume more time and computing resources. So the intelligent selection of useful features for the model training will ultimately improve this drawback.</p><p>Based on the reviewed article, it is observed that during the past three years, the researchers focused on DL tools for designing the IDS system as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>. It is noticed that 60% of the proposed methods are purely based on the DL approaches, 20% solutions use hybrid approach involving the combination of ML-and DL-based algorithms while only 20% proposed solutions are based on ML methods. As discussed earlier, DL models are complex in nature and require extensive computational resources. This is made possible due to the advent of the GPU and has contributed to a vast increase in the use of DL-based algorithms in the design of IDS.</p><p>Moreover, Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows the number of times ML-or DL-based algorithms are adopted by the researchers in the context of designing an efficient IDS solution. It is observed that the four most frequent algorithms used are AE, DNN, CNN, and RNN, respectively, which are all DL in nature. Then the ML-based approaches like RF and SVM come in the list and are mostly used in the hybrid design to assist and improve DL-based algorithms. Also, ML-based algorithms like DT, KNN, and FLN are less frequently adopted algorithms during the reviewed period.</p><p>From the reviewed articles, it is observed that AE and its different variations are one of the most utilized algorithms adopted for proposing NIDS solutions. Mostly, AE is adopted specifically used for feature extractions and reduction, followed by the ML-based classifier for classification purposes.

It is also observed that few proposed methodologies combined two or more DL algorithms in a model. Although these types of methodologies improved the detection accuracy but it is done at the cost of more complexity which demands high computing resources. Similarly, sometimes the data need to be transformed in the format to be used for some specific algorithm. For instance, to use CNN specifically for NIDS, the transformation of data from one-dimensional data vector (feature set) into a two-dimensional matrix is required.</p><p>The analysis of the performance metrics used by the researchers for the evaluation of the methodology is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>. It is noted that the most widely used performance metrics are Detection Accuracy and Recall (Detection rate). It is obvious that for efficient network security, the IDS demands a higher Accuracy and Detection rate. So, to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methodology, these two performance metrics should be considered. For a typical IDS designed using ML / DL tools, the Accuracy, Recall, and F-measure should be the compulsory performance metric besides others to show its ability in detecting intrusions.</p><p>Benchmark datasets are an important ingredient used to test the performance of the proposed methodology. The analysis for the use of the public datasets is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>. It is illustrated that 60% times NSL-KDD and KDD Cup'99 were used for testing and validating purposes. Both of these are quite old datasets but are still very popular to use among researchers due to the availability of extensive results in the literature. Modern network architecture is quite different from the one 20 years ago. In this era of IoT, security, and privacy of the big data and sensor nodes are a prime concern due to the rapid generation of novel attacks. If a new IDS methodology proposed for the modern networks is tested using an old dataset, there are more chances that the proposed method will not perform well when deployed in the real-world environment. It is quite obvious that a model trained and verified using the latest dataset will perform comparatively better than the model trained and verified using an old dataset in the real world.</p><p>KDD Cup'99 24% NSL-KDD 36% Kyoto 6% UNSW-NB15 18% CIC-IDS2017 &amp; CSE-CIC-IDS2018 12% Others 4%</p><p>F I G U R E 10 Datasets distribution</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Research challenges</head><p>This subsection highlights the research challenges in the field of IDS.</p><p>1. Unavailability of a systematic dataset: The current study highlighted the unavailability of an up to date dataset that reflects the new attacks for modern networks. Most of the proposed methodologies were not able to detect zero-day attacks because these models were not trained with enough attack types and patterns. To come up with an efficient IDS model, it needs to be tested and verified using the dataset having older and newer attacks. By including the maximum number of attacks definition in a dataset will enable the ML/DL model to learn more patterns and eventually will provide protection against maximum intrusions of different types. But dataset construction is an expensive process that demands a lot of resources and high experts' knowledge. Hence, one of the research challenges for IDS is the systematic construction of an up-to-date dataset with enough instances of almost all the attack types. The dataset should be updated frequently to include the latest intrusion instances and should be made public to help the research community. 2. Lower detection accuracy due to imbalance dataset: It is also noted from the current study that most of the proposed IDS methodologies exhibit lower detection accuracy for certain attack types than the overall detection accuracy of the model. This problem is caused by the imbalance nature of the dataset. The detection accuracy for low frequent attacks class is lower than the attacks with more instances. There can be two solutions to this problem. The first is to come up with an up-to-date and balanced dataset. The second solution is to come up with efficient techniques that can increase the number of minority attack instances to balance the dataset. Recently, researchers used certain techniques like SMOTE, RandomOverSampler, and adaptive synthetic sampling approach (ADASYN Algorithm), etc. for reducing the dataset imbalance ratio for improved performance. But there is still room for improvement and demands more research in this direction. 3. Low performance in real-world environment: Another research challenge for IDS is their performance in the real-world environment. Since most of the proposed methodologies are tested and verified within a lab using the public datasets. None of the proposed methodologies is tested in a real-world environment. So, it is still not clear how they will perform in real-world scenarios. As stated, most of them still rely on testing using old datasets. So the biggest challenge for the proposed methodology is to be as efficient as demonstrated in the lab tests. The proposed method once tested in the lab should also be tested in a real-time environment to verify its effectiveness for modern networks. 4. Resources consumed by complex models: Most IDS methodologies proposed by the researcher are based on very complex models that require a lot of time in processing and computing resources (almost 80% DL-based methods or DL-ML based methods). This may result in extra overhead for the processing unit and ultimately affects the performance of IDS. The use of a multi-core high-performance GPU can speed up the computation process and reduce time, but it will cost a huge amount of money. Similarly, So to reduce the computational and processing overhead, an efficient feature selection algorithm is needed to intelligently selects the most important features for faster processing. Although many optimization algorithms are being explored by the researchers for feature selection, there is still scope of improvement and research can be carried out in this direction to come up with an efficient feature selection optimization algorithm. 5. Lightweight IDS for IoT: An IDS can also be used to provide security to the IoT network and its associated sensor nodes. In an IoT environment, sensor nodes collect a huge amount of critical data that is shared through the internet.</p><p>Sensor nodes are resource-constrained with limited computational power, storage capacity, and battery life. IDS can either be deployed at the points where network traffic enters into the IoT network from the internet, or it can be deployed in a distributed manner over the sensor nodes. In the first scenario, the NIDS needs to be efficient in detecting malicious attacks and poses the same challenges as discussed earlier. In the second scenario, for the resource-limited sensor nodes, a lightweight IDS model is needed. So the design of a lightweight IDS model which is efficient in terms of computational power, training time, and with higher intrusion detection rate is one of the biggest challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Future trends</head><p>This subsection highlights the future scope in ML-/ DL-based IDS research.</p><p>1. Efficient NIDS framework: NIDS is one of the important defense mechanism to a network against intrusions. Recent studies show its limitation in detecting zero-day attacks with a high false alarm. To this end, the performance of IDS can be improved by using an up-to-date, systematic, and balanced dataset. There are very few attempts by the researchers to propose an efficient and complete NIDS framework for a network (more specifically for modern networks like an IoT <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">138</ref> ). Research can be carried in this direction to propose an efficient NIDS framework that can provide complete security against intrusions. The IDS framework should include a mechanism to frequently update the attack definitions in a dataset and keep on training the model with the updated definitions to make the model learn new features. This will eventually improve the IDS model in detecting zero-day attacks and decrease false alarms. The training phase of an ML-or DL-based IDS model normally takes a long time and can be performed offline. The key to attack detection and accuracy of a model lies in the constant process of dataset updating and training for AI-based IDS systems. 2. Solution to complex models: According to recent studies, DL-based IDSs have gained enormous popularity due to deep feature learning ability to produce excellent results in detecting malicious attacks. The models which are based on DL algorithms are quite complex and require high resources in terms of computational power, storage capacity, and time. These complex structures put extra challenges for IDS to be implemented in real-time environments. To address these problems, one solution is to use high-performance GPUs for the processing of big datasets quickly and efficiently. But these GPUs are normally expensive. So there is a tradeoff between performance and cost. To reduce cost, cloud-based GPU platforms or services can be explored for model training purposes. Another solution to this problem is to try reducing the complexity of DL algorithms by doing efficient and intelligent feature engineering. By selecting only the key features will result in almost the same detection accuracy as obtained using the complete set of features. This will eventually decrease the complexity of the model and will utilize fewer computing resources in a real-time environment. 3. Use of DL algorithms: Recent studies suggested the use of DL-based algorithms for an IDS design. Many DL algorithms (as discussed in this Section 4) are explored and used efficiently in proposing effective solutions. But there are still some DL algorithms that require more attention like deep reinforcement learning, Hidden Markov Models, etc. for proposing IDS solution for IoT network. The research to use DL for IDS is still in the early stages. Researchers can also explore the hybrid idea of using DL for feature extraction and ML for classification. This will reduce the complexity of the proposed model. 4. Efficient NIDS for cyber-physical systems: Recently, a massive interest is shown in Cyber-Physical Systems such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-enabled networks. SCADA networks have various applications, such as smart grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">139</ref> and manufacturing industries, etc. However, SCADA networks are becoming more and more complex as state-of-the-art information and communication technologies (ICT) are embedded within the network, thus providing an opportunity for the attackers to be part of the network. NIDS plays an important role in such networks, where these can detect intruders by inspecting the network traffic. Further, the use of ML and DL will increase the efficiency of NIDS, as it can provide an extra dimension to detect cyber attacks within the SCADA networks. However, the research in this domain is still in early-stage and more investigation is required to identify and design efficient DL-based NIDS for SCADA networks. Similarly, UAV-enabled networks also offer a wide range of applications, including traffic monitoring, asset inspection, and securing critical infrastructure, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">140</ref> Due to the nature of communication involved over the wireless channel, these networks are accessible not only to legitimate users but also susceptible to the network intruders, which can not only monitor the communication but can also launch various attacks. Therefore, an efficient and intelligent NIDS is required which can detect the intruders within UAV-enabled networks. Furthermore, the use of AI within the NIDS for UAV-enabled networks can be an interesting research direction, which requires more exploration and investigation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">141,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">142</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper provides an extensive review of the network intrusion detection mechanisms based on the ML and DL methods to provide the new researchers with the updated knowledge, recent trends, and progress of the field. A systematic approach is adopted for the selection of the relevant articles in the field of AI-based NIDS. Firstly, the concept of IDS and its different classification schemes is elaborated extensively based on the reviewed articles. Then the methodology of each article is discussed and the strengths and weaknesses of each are highlighted in terms of the intrusion detection capability and complexity of the model. Based on this study, the recent trend reveals the usage of DL-based methodologies to improve the performance and effectiveness of NIDS in terms of detection accuracy and reduction in FAR. About 80% of the proposed solutions were based on the DL approaches with AE and DNN are the most frequently used algorithms.</p><p>Although DL schemes have much superior performance than the ML-based methods in terms of their ability to learn features by itself and stronger model fitting abilities. But these schemes are quite complex and require extensive computing resources in terms of processing power and storage capabilities. These challenges need to be addressed to fulfill real-time requirements for NIDS and hence improves NIDS performance.</p><p>The study also shows that 60% of the proposed methodologies were tested using KDD Cup'99 and NSL-KDD datasets mainly because of the availability of extensive results using these datasets. But these datasets are quite old to address modern network attacks, and hence limits the performance of the proposed methodologies in real-time environments. For AI-based NIDS methods, the model should be tested with the latest updated dataset like CSE-CIC-IDS2018 for better performance in terms of detection accuracy for intrusions. This article also highlights the research gaps in improving the model performance for low-frequency attacks in a real-world environment and to find efficient solutions to reduce complexity for the proposed models. Proposing an efficient NIDS framework using less complex DL algorithms and have an effective detection mechanism is a potential future scope of research in this area. For future research, we will use this knowledge to design a novel, lightweight, and efficient DL-based NIDS which will effectively detect the intruders within the network.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>F</head></figure>
