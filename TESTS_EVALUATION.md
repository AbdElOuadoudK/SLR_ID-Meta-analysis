# Tests Directory Evaluation

## Summary
- Reviewed the repository history and current tree to determine whether a `/tests` directory or its submodules are present.
- Confirmed that the project has no `/tests` directory in the current commit history (`git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep tests` returned no matches).
- No code references, CI hooks, or imports rely on a `/tests` package, so no removal action is required.

## Decision
Because a `/tests` directory is absent and no components depend on it, no changes were made to remove tests. This preserves the repository's stability and avoids introducing unnecessary modifications.

## Assumptions & Trade-offs
- Assumes the authoritative branch is `work`, which currently lacks any `/tests` assets.
- Removing non-existent directories would be a no-op; documenting the evaluation keeps the decision reproducible for future maintainers.
